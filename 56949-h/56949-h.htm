  <h2 class='c004'>NOTE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>WHEN the unfortunate man standing on the
scaffold was asked by a spectator to make a
speech, he said that, considering the interesting programme
which had been prepared by their good
friend the Sheriff, he could not hope to say anything
likely to amuse them. The compiler of a book of
humour may recognise a like anxiety on the part
of the public to push on to the principal attraction.
There arises on his mental vision the eager face
of the book-buyer, as he hurriedly skims over the
leaves at the commencement of the volume, to find
the end of the introduction and the beginning of
the humour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once upon a time when I was young—in fact, more
than eighteen months ago—I wrote an introduction to
a volume of American humorous verse. It didn’t say
much, but it covered a great deal of space, and looked
imposing. The few statements made, however, have
risen up and smitten me night and day, and I have
never to this moment been able to get away from
them. After the volume had been before the public
for a few months, I made an everlasting resolve to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>abstain from all theories, deductions, speculations, prophecies,
warnings, and prognostications in regard to
any and every humour, whether American or British,
new or old, known or unknown. It occurred to me
that a new and delightful feature might be added to
a book of humour if the reader were permitted the
privilege of forming his own conclusions and choosing
for himself his favourite among the authors. No
doubt many a man has been forced, sorely against
his will, to acknowledge, theoretically, the irresistibility
of certain writers’ humour, and to spend the
best part of his life in trying to see something funny
in the writers’ work. No such hopeless task will be
imposed by this volume. The different authors
included between the covers of this book will speak
for themselves. They need no bush.</p>

<p class='c009'>But instead of writing an introduction for no one to
read I have thought it better to arrange a biographical
index of American and Canadian humorous writers,
giving such pertinent particulars of each author’s
life and work as may be of value to the student of
American literature. This index will be found
at the end of the volume. It comes, it is hoped,
within reasonable distance of completeness, and
although in the majority of cases the data
given is of a broad and general kind, still it is
sufficiently explicit to set the student in the way
of finding for himself the chief characteristics and
work of the different authors. This index, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>best of my knowledge, is the first of its kind that has
been arranged, and should at least prove of benefit to
any unfortunate compiler who in future ages is asked
to prepare a volume of humorous extracts from
American authors. The job is a big one now.
What it will be if America continues to produce
“funny” men at the rate she has done for the past
hundred years it is impossible to imagine.</p>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion, I gladly acknowledge my indebtedness
for particulars of the works of many writers to
Mr. Oscar Fay Adams’ valuable little work, <i>Handbook
of American Authors</i>. The dates which appear
in this book are chiefly taken from Appleton’s <i>Dictionary
of American Biography</i>.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“KOSCIUSKO AND I FROLICKED AROUND.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_65 c008'>I HAVE owned quite a number of dogs in my life, but
they are all dead now. Last evening I visited my dog
cemetery—just between the gloaming and the shank of the
evening. On the biscuit-box cover that stands at the head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of a little mound fringed with golden rod and pickle bottles,
the idler may still read these lines, etched in red chalk by a
trembling hand—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>LITTLE KOSCIUSKO,</div>
    <div>.........NOT DEAD.........</div>
    <div>BUT JERKED HENCE</div>
    <div>BY REQUEST.</div>
    <div>S. Y. L.</div>
    <div>(SEE YOU LATER.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I do not know why he was called Kosciusko. I do not
care. I only know that his little grave stands out there
while the gloaming gloams and the soughing winds are
soughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do you ask why I am alone here and dogless in this
weary world?</p>

<p class='c009'>I will tell you, anyhow. It will not take long, and it may
do me good: Kosciusko came to me one night in winter,
with no baggage, and unidentified.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I opened the door he came in as though he had
left something in there by mistake and had returned for it.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stayed with us two years as a watch-dog. In a
desultory way, he was a good watch-dog. If he had
watched other people with the same unrelenting scrutiny
with which he watched me, I might have felt his death more
keenly than I do now.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second year that little Kosciusko was with us, I
shaved off a full beard one day while down town, put on a
clean collar and otherwise disguised myself, intending to
surprise my wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kosciusko sat on the front porch when I returned. He
looked at me as a cashier of a bank does when a newspaper
man goes in to get a suspiciously large cheque cashed.
He did not know me. I said, “Kosciusko, have you forgotten
your master’s voice?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>He smiled sarcastically, showing his glorious wealth of
mouth, but still sat there as though he had stuck his tail
into the door-steps and couldn’t get it out.</p>

<p class='c009'>So I waived the formality of going in at the front door,
and went around to the portcullis, on the off side of the
house, but Kosciusko was there when I arrived. The cook,
seeing a stranger lurking around the manor-house, encouraged
Kosciusko to come and gorge himself with a part of
my leg, which he did. Acting on this hint I went to the
barn.</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not know why I went to the barn, but somehow
there was nothing in the house that I wanted. When a
man wants to be by himself there is no place like a good,
quiet barn for thought. So I went into the barn, about
three feet prior to Kosciusko.</p>

<p class='c009'>Noticing the stairway, I ascended it in an aimless kind of
way, about four steps at a time. What happened when we
got into the haymow I do not now recall, only that Kosciusko
and I frolicked around there in the hay for some time.
Occasionally I would be on the top, and then he would
have all the delegates, until finally I got hold of a pitchfork,
and freedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell. I wrapped myself
up in an old horse-net and went into the house. Some
of my clothes were afterwards found in the hay, and the
doctor pried a part of my person out of Kosciusko’s jaws,
but not enough to do me any good.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have owned, in all, eleven dogs, and they all died violent
deaths, and went out of the world totally unprepared to
die.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>BAKED BEANS AND CULTURE</i>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>THE members of the Boston Commercial Club are
charming gentlemen. They are now the guests of
the Chicago Commercial Club, and are being shown every
attention that our market affords. They are a fine-looking
lot, well-dressed and well-mannered, with just enough
whiskers to be impressive without being imposing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is a darned likely village,” said Seth Adams last
evening. “Everybody is rushin’ ’round an’ doin’ business
as if his life depended on it. Should think they’d git all
tuckered out ’fore night, but I’ll be darned if there ain’t
just as many folks on the street after nightfall as afore.
We’re stoppin’ at the Palmer tavern; an’ my chamber is
up so all-fired high, that I can count all your meetin’-house
steeples from the winder.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Last night five or six of these Boston merchants sat
around the office of the hotel, and discussed matters and
things. Pretty soon they got to talking about beans: this
was the subject which they dwelt on with evident pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Waal, sir,” said Ephraim Taft, a wholesale dealer in
maple-sugar and flavoured lozenges, “you kin talk ’bout
your new-fashioned dishes an’ high-falutin’ vittles; but,
when you come right down to it, there ain’t no better
eatin’ than a dish o’ baked pork ’n’ beans.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“That’s so, b’ gosh!” chorussed the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The truth o’ the matter is,” continued Mr. Taft, “that
beans is good for everybody,—’t don’t make no difference
whether he’s well or sick. Why, I’ve known a thousand
folks—waal, mebbe not quite a thousand; but,—waal, now,
jest to show, take the case of Bill Holbrook: you remember
Bill, don’t ye?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill Holbrook?” said Mr. Ezra Eastman; “why, of
course I do! Used to live down to Brimfield, next to the
Moses Howard farm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s the man,” resumed Mr. Taft. “Waal, Bill fell
sick,—kinder moped round, tired like, for a week or two,
an’ then tuck to his bed. His folks sent for Dock Smith,—ol’
Dock Smith that used to carry round a pair o’ leather
saddlebags,—gosh, they don’t have no sech doctors nowadays!
Waal, the dock, he come; an’ he looked at Bill’s
tongue, an’ felt uv his pulse, an’ said that Bill had typhus
fever. Ol’ Dock Smith was a very careful, conserv’tive
man, an’ he never said nothin’ unless he knowed he was
right.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill began to git wuss, an’ he kep’ a-gittin’ wuss every
day. One mornin’ ol’ Dock Smith sez, ‘Look a-here, Bill,
I guess you’re a goner: as I figger it, you can’t hol’ out till
nightfall.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill’s mother insisted on a con-sul-tation bein’ held; so
ol’ Dock Smith sent over for young Dock Brainerd. I
calc’late that, next <i>to</i> ol’ Dock Smith, young Dock Brainerd
was the smartest doctor that ever lived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Waal, pretty soon along come Dock Brainerd; an’ he
an’ Dock Smith went all over Bill, an’ looked at his tongue,
an’ felt uv his pulse, an’ told him it was a gone case, an’
that he had got to die. Then they went off into the spare
chamber to hold their con-sul-tation.</p>

the clothes-press, an’ she left the door ajar as she come in.
Bill he gave a sniff, an’ his eyes grew more natural like:

<p class='c009'>“‘Look a-here,’ says she; ‘Mr. Holbrook smelt the
beans cookin’, an’ he says he’s got to have a plate uv ’em.
Now, what shall I do about it?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Waal, doctor,’ says Dock Smith, ‘what do you think
’bout it?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘He’s got to die anyhow,’ says Dock Brainerd; ‘an’ I
don’t suppose the beans’ll make any diff’rence.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘That’s the way I figger it,’ says Dock Smith; ‘in all
my practice I never knew of beans hurtin’ anybody.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“So Sary went down to the kitchen, an’ brought up a
plateful of hot baked beans. Dock Smith raised Bill up
in bed, an’ Dock Brainerd put a piller under the small
of Bill’s back. Then Sary sat down by the bed, an’ fed
them beans into Bill until Bill couldn’t hold any more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘How air you feelin’ now?’ asked Dock Smith.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill didn’t say nuthin’: he jest smiled sort uv peaceful

<p class='c009'>“‘The end hez come,’ said Dock Brainerd sof’ly; ‘Bill
is dyin’.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then Bill murmured kind o’ far-away like (as if he
was dreamin’), ‘I ain’t dyin’: I’m dead an’ in heaven.’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Next mornin’ Bill got out uv bed, an’ done a big

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE NICE PEOPLE.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>“THEY certainly are nice people,” I assented to my
wife’s observation, using the colloquial phrase with
a consciousness that it was anything but “nice” English,
“and I’ll bet that their three children are better brought
up than most of——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Two</i> children,” corrected my wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three, he told me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear, she said there were <i>two</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said three.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve simply forgotten. I’m <i>sure</i> she told me they
had only two—a boy and a girl.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I didn’t enter into particulars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No dear, and you couldn’t have understood him. Two
children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right,” I said; but I did not think it was all right.
As a near-sighted man learns by enforced observation to
recognise persons at a distance when the face is not visible
to the normal eye, so the man with a bad memory learns,
almost unconsciously, to listen carefully and report accurately.
My memory is bad; but I had not had time to
forget that Mr. Brewster Brede had told me that afternoon
that he had three children, at present left in the care of his
mother-in-law, while he and Mrs. Brede took their summer
vacation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Two children,” repeated my wife; “and they are staying
with his aunt Jenny.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“He told me with his mother-in-law,” I put in. My wife
looked at me with a serious expression. Men may not
remember much of what they are told about children; but
any man knows the difference between an aunt and a
mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But don’t you think they’re nice people?” asked my wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, certainly,” I replied; “only they seem to be a little
mixed up about their children.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib013.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“SEATED THEMSELVES OPPOSITE US AT TABLE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“That isn’t a nice thing to say,” returned my wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>I could not deny it.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>And yet the next morning, when the Bredes came down
and seated themselves opposite us at table, beaming and
smiling in their natural, pleasant, well-bred fashion, I knew,
to a social certainty, that they <i>were</i> “nice” people. He was
a fine-looking fellow in his neat tennis-flannels, slim, graceful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>twenty-eight or thirty years old, with a Frenchy-pointed
beard. She was “nice” in all her pretty clothes, and she
herself was pretty with that type of prettiness which out-wears
most other types—the prettiness that lies in a
rounded figure, a dusky skin, plump, rosy cheeks, white
teeth, and black eyes. She might have been twenty-five;
you guessed that she was prettier than she was at twenty,
and that she would be prettier still at forty.</p>

<p class='c009'>And nice people were all we wanted to make us happy in
Mr. Jacobus’s summer boarding-house on the top of Orange
Mountain. For a week we had come down to breakfast
each morning, wondering why we wasted the precious days
of idleness with the company gathered around the Jacobus
board. What joy of human companionship was to be had
out of Mrs. Tabb and Miss Hoogencamp, the two middle-aged
gossips from Scranton, Pa.,—out of Mr. and Mrs. Biggle,
an indurated head-bookkeeper and his prim and censorious
wife,—out of old Major Halkit, a retired business man,
who, having once sold a few shares on commission, wrote
for circulars of every stock company that was started, and
tried to induce every one to invest who would listen to him?
We looked around at those dull faces, the truthful indices
of mean and barren minds, and decided that we would leave
that morning. Then we ate Mrs. Jacobus’s biscuits, light
as Aurora’s cloudlets, drank her honest coffee, inhaled the
perfume of the late azaleas with which she decked her table,
and decided to postpone our departure one more day. And
then we wandered out to take our morning glance at what
we called “our view”; and it seemed to us as if Tabb and
Hoogencamp, and Halkit and the Biggles could not drive
us away in a year.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was not surprised when, after breakfast, my wife invited
the Bredes to walk with us to “our view.” The Hoogencamp-Biggle-Tabb-Halkit
contingent never stirred off
Jacobus’s verandah; but we both felt that the Bredes would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>not profane that sacred scene. We strolled slowly across
the fields, passed through the little belt of wood, and as I
heard Mrs. Brede’s little cry of startled rapture, I motioned
to Brede to look up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By Jove!” he cried; “heavenly!”</p>

<p class='c009'>We looked off from the brow of the mountain over fifteen
miles of billowing green, to where, far across a far stretch of
pale blue, lay a dim purple line that we knew was Staten
Island. Towns and villages lay before us and under us;
there were ridges and hills, uplands and lowlands, woods
and plains, all massed and mingled in that great silent sea of
sunlit green. For silent it was to us, standing in the silence
of a high place—silent with a Sunday stillness that made us
listen, without taking thought, for the sound of bells coming
up from the spires that rose above the tree-tops—the tree-tops
that lay as far beneath us as the light clouds were above
us that dropped great shadows upon our heads and faint
specks of shade upon the broad sweep of land at the mountain’s
foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so that is <i>your</i> view?” asked Mrs. Brede, after a
moment; “you are very generous to make it ours too.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we lay down on the grass, and Brede began to talk
in a gentle voice, as if he felt the influence of the place.
He had paddled a canoe, in his earlier days, he said, and he
knew every river and creek in that vast stretch of landscape.
He found his landmarks, and pointed out to us where the
Passaic and the Hackensack flowed, invisible to us, hidden
behind great ridges that in our sight were but combings of
the green waves upon which we looked down, and yet on
the further side of those broad ridges and rises were scores
of villages—a little world of country life, lying unseen under
our eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A good deal like looking at humanity,” he said; “there
is such a thing as getting so far above our fellow-men that
we see only one side of them.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Ah, how much better was this sort of talk than the chatter
and gossip of the Tabb and the Hoogencamp—than the
Major’s dissertations upon his everlasting circulars! My
wife and I exchanged glances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, when I went up the Matterhorn,” Mr. Brede began.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, dear,” interrupted his wife; “I didn’t know you
ever went up the Matterhorn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It—it was five years ago,” said Mr. Brede hurriedly; “I—I
didn’t tell you—when I was on the other side, you know—it
was rather dangerous—well, as I was saying—it looked—oh,
it didn’t look at all like this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A cloud floated overhead, throwing its great shadow
over the field where we lay. The shadow passed over
the mountain’s brow, and reappeared far below, a rapidly
decreasing blot; flying eastward over the golden green.
My wife and I exchanged glances once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Somehow the shadow lingered over us all. As we went
home, the Bredes went side by side along the narrow path,
and my wife and I walked together.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Should you think</i>,” she asked me, “that a man would
climb the Matterhorn the very first year he was married?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know, my dear,” I answered evasively; “this
isn’t the first year I have been married, not by a good
many, and I wouldn’t climb it—for a farm.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know what I mean?” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>When we reached the boarding-house, Mr. Jacobus took
me aside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know,” he began his discourse, “my wife, she used
to live in N’ York!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I didn’t know; but I said, “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She says the numbers on the streets runs criss-cross
like. Thirty-four’s on one side o’ the street, an’ thirty-five’s
on t’other. How’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“That is the invariable rule, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then—I say—these here new folk that you ’n’ your wife
seems so mighty taken up with—d’ye know anything about
’em?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know nothing about the character of your boarders,
Mr. Jacobus,” I replied, conscious of some irritability. “If
I choose to associate with any of them——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jess so—jess so!” broke in Jacobus. “I hain’t nothin’
to say ag’inst yer sosherbil’ty. But do ye <i>know</i> them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, certainly not,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—that was all I wuz askin’ ye. Ye see, when <i>he</i>
come here to take the rooms—you wasn’t here then—he
told my wife that he lived at number thirty-four in his
street. An’ yistiddy <i>she</i> told her that they lived at number
thirty-five. He said he lived in an apartment-house. Now,
there can’t be no apartment-house on two sides of the same
street, kin they?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What street was it?” I inquired wearily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hunderd’n’ twenty-first street.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe,” I replied, still more wearily. “That’s Harlem.
Nobody knows what people will do in Harlem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I went up to my wife’s room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you think it queer?” she asked me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I’ll have a talk with that young man to-night,”
I said, “and see if he can give some account of himself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, my dear,” my wife said gravely, “<i>she</i> doesn’t know
whether they’ve had the measles or not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Great Scott!” I exclaimed, “they must have had
them when they were children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please don’t be stupid,” said my wife. “I meant <i>their</i>
children.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>After dinner that night—or rather after supper, for we
had dinner in the middle of the day at Jacobus’s—I walked
down the long verandah to ask Brede, who was placidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>smoking at the other end, to accompany me on a twilight
stroll. Half-way down I met Major Halkit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That friend of yours,” he said, indicating the unconscious
figure at the further end of the house, “seems to be
a queer sort of a Dick. He told me that he was out of
business, and just looking round for a chance to invest his
capital. And I’ve been telling him what an everlasting big
show he had to take stock in the Capitoline Trust Company—starts
next month—four million capital; I told you
all about it. ‘Oh, well,’ he says, ‘let’s wait and think
about it.’ ‘Wait!’ says I; ‘the Capitoline Trust Company
won’t wait for <i>you</i>, my boy. This is letting you in on
the ground floor,’ says I; ‘and it’s now or never.’ ‘Oh,
let it wait,’ says he. I don’t know what’s in-<i>to</i> the man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know how well he knows his own business,
Major,” I said as I started again for Brede’s end of the
verandah. But I was troubled none the less. The Major
could not have influenced the sale of one share of stock in
the Capitoline Company. But that stock was a great investment;
a rare chance for a purchaser with a few thousand
dollars. Perhaps it was no more remarkable that Brede
should not invest than that I should not; and yet it seemed
to add one circumstance more to the other suspicious
circumstances.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>When I went upstairs that evening, I found my wife
putting her hair to bed—I don’t know how I can better
describe an operation familiar to every married man. I
waited until the last tress was coiled up, and then I
spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve talked with Brede,” I said, “and I didn’t have to
catechise him. He seemed to feel that some sort of
explanation was looked for, and he was very outspoken.
You were right about the children—that is, I must have misunderstood
him. There are only two; but the Matterhorn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>episode was simple enough. He didn’t realise how
dangerous it was until he had got so far into it that he
couldn’t back out; and he didn’t tell her, because he’d left
her here, you see; and under the circumstances——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Left her here!” cried my wife. “I’ve been sitting with
her the whole afternoon, sewing, and she told me that he
left her at Geneva, and came back and took her to Basle,
and the baby was born there. Now I’m sure, dear, because
I asked her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I was mistaken when I thought he said she
was on this side of the water,” I suggested with bitter, biting
irony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You poor dear, did I abuse you?” said my wife. “But
do you know Mrs. Tabb said that <i>she</i> didn’t know how
many lumps of sugar he took in his coffee. Now that
seems queer, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It did. It was a small thing; but it looked queer, very
queer.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>The next morning it was clear that war was declared
against the Bredes. They came down to breakfast somewhat
late, and as soon as they arrived the Biggles swooped
up the last fragments that remained on their plates, and
made a stately march out of the dining-room. Then Miss
Hoogencamp arose and departed, leaving a whole fish-ball
on her plate. Even as Atalanta might have dropped an
apple behind her to tempt her pursuer to check his speed,
so Miss Hoogencamp left that fish-ball behind her, and
between her maiden self and Contamination.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had finished our breakfast, my wife and I, before the
Bredes appeared. We talked it over, and agreed that we
were glad that we had not been obliged to take sides upon
such insufficient testimony.</p>

<p class='c009'>After breakfast it was the custom of the male half of the
Jacobus household to go around the corner of the building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and smoke their pipes and cigars, where they would not
annoy the ladies. We sat under a trellis covered with a
grape vine that had borne no grapes in the memory of man.
This vine, however, bore leaves, and these, on that pleasant
summer morning, shielded from us two persons who were
in earnest conversation in the straggling, half-dead flower-garden
at the side of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want,” we heard Mr. Jacobus say, “to enter in
no man’s <i>pry</i>-vacy; but I do want to know who it may be,
like, that I hev in my house. Now what I ask of <i>you</i>—and
I don’t want you to take it as in no ways <i>personal</i>—is, hev
you your merridge-licence with you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” we heard the voice of Mr. Brede reply. “Have
you yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I think it was a chance shot, but it told all the same.
The Major (he was a widower), and Mr. Biggle and I
looked at each other; and Mr. Jacobus, on the other side
of the grape-trellis, looked at—I don’t know what—and was
as silent as we were.</p>

<p class='c009'>Where is <i>your</i> marriage-licence, married reader? Do you
know? Four men, not including Mr. Brede, stood or sat
on one side or the other of that grape-trellis, and not one of
them knew where his marriage-licence was. Each of us had
had one—the Major had had three. But where were they?
Where is <i>yours</i>? Tucked in your best-man’s pocket;
deposited in his desk, or washed to a pulp in his white
waistcoat (if white waistcoats be the fashion of the hour),
washed out of existence—can you tell where it is? Can
you—unless you are one of those people who frame that
interesting document and hang it upon their drawing-room
walls?</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Brede’s voice arose, after an awful stillness of what
seemed like five minutes, and was, probably, thirty
seconds—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Jacobus, will you make out your bill at once, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>let me pay it? I shall leave by the six o’clock train. And
will you also send the waggon for my trunks?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hain’t said I wanted to hev ye leave——” began Mr.
Jacobus; but Brede cut him short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring me your bill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” remonstrated Jacobus, “ef ye ain’t——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bring me your bill!” said Mr. Brede.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>My wife and I went out for our morning’s walk. But it
seemed to us, when we looked at “our view,” as if we could
only see those invisible villages of which Brede had told
us—that other side of the ridges and rises of which we
catch no glimpse from lofty hills or from the heights of
human self-esteem. We meant to stay out until the Bredes
had taken their departure; but we returned just in time to
see Pete, the Jacobus darkey, the blacker of boots, the
brusher of coats, the general handy-man of the house,
loading the Bredes’ trunks on the Jacobus waggon.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, as we stepped upon the verandah, down came Mrs.
Brede, leaning on Mr. Brede’s arm as though she were ill;
and it was clear that she had been crying—there were
heavy rings about her pretty black eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>My wife took a step towards her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at that dress, dear,” she whispered; “she never
thought anything like this was going to happen when she
put <i>that</i> on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a pretty, delicate, dainty dress, a graceful, narrow-striped
affair. Her hat was trimmed with a narrow-striped
silk of the same colour—maroon and white; and in her
hand she held a parasol that matched her dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s had a new dress on twice a day,” said my wife;
“but that’s the prettiest yet. Oh, somehow—I’m <i>awfully</i>
sorry they’re going!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But going they were. They moved towards the steps.
Mrs. Brede looked towards my wife, and my wife moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>towards Mrs. Brede. But the ostracised woman, as though
she felt the deep humiliation of her position, turned sharply
away, and opened her parasol to shield her eyes from the
sun. A shower of rice—a half-pound shower of rice—fell
down over her pretty hat and her pretty dress, and fell in a
splattering circle on the floor, outlining her skirts, and there
it lay in a broad, uneven band, and bright in the morning
sun.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Mrs. Brede was in my wife’s arms, sobbing as if her
young heart would break.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you poor, dear, silly children!” my wife cried, as
Mrs. Brede sobbed on her shoulder; “why <i>didn’t</i> you
tell us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“W-w-we didn’t want to be t-t-taken for a b-b-b-b-bridal
couple,” sobbed Mrs. Brede; “and we d-d-didn’t <i>dream</i>

mixed-up mess of it. Oh, dear, dear, dear!”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>“Pete!” commanded Mr. Jacobus, “put back them
trunks. These folks stays here’s long’s they wants ter.
Mr. Brede”—he held out a large, hard hand—“I’d orter
’ve known better,” he said; and my last doubt of Mr. Brede
vanished as he shook that grimy hand in manly fashion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two women were walking off toward “our view,”
each with an arm about the other’s waist—touched by a
sudden sisterhood of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Brede, addressing Jacobus, Biggle,
the Major, and me, “there is a hostelry down the street
where they sell honest New Jersey beer. I recognise the
obligations of the situation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We five men filed down the street, and the two women
went toward the pleasant slope where the sunlight gilded
the forehead of the great hill. On Mr. Jacobus’s verandah
lay a spattered circle of shining grains of rice. Two of Mr.
Jacobus’s pigeons flew down and picked up the shining
grains, making grateful noises far down in their throats.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes—that’s the regular fare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No discount to a regular traveller?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We make no discount from that figure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ye wouldn’t take half of it in trade?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I want your fare at once, or we will have to land
you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t want a nice rat-trap, do ye, stranger?” inquired
the passenger. “One which sets herself, works on scientific
principles, allus ready, painted a nice green, wanted by every
family, warranted to knock the socks off’n any other trap
ever invented by mortal man?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir; I want the money!” replied the clerk in
emphatic tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, wall, I’ll pay; of course I will,” said the rat-trap
man; “but that’s an awful figger for a ride to Orleans, and
cash is cash these days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He counted out the fare in ragged shin-plasters, wound a
shoe-string around his wallet and replaced it, and then unlocked
one of the satchels and took out a wire rat-trap.
Proceeding to the cabin, he looked the ground over, and
then waltzing up to a young lady who sat on a sofa reading,
he began—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I take great pleasure in presenting to your attention the
Eureky rat-trap, the best trap ever invented. It sets——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir!” she exclaimed, rising to her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Name’s Harrington Baker,” he went on, turning the trap
around on his outstretched hand, “and I guarantee this
trap to do more square killing among rats than——”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gave him a look of scorn and contempt, and swept
grandly away; and without being the least put out he walked
over to a bald-headed man who had tilted his chair back
and fallen asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fellow-mortal, awakest and gaze upon the Eureky rat-trap,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>said the stranger, as he laid his hand on the shiny
pate of the sleeper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wh—who—what!” exclaimed the Bald-head, opening
his eyes and flinging his arms around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I take this opportunity to call your attention to my
Eureky rat-trap,” continued the new passenger; “the
noblest Roman of them all. Try one, and you will use
no other. It is constructed on——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who in thunder do you take me for?” exclaimed the
bald-headed man at this point. “What in blazes do I want
of your rat-trap?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To ketch rats!” humbly replied the stranger; “to clear
yer premises of one of the most obnoxious pests known to
man. I believe I am safe in saying that this ’ere——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go away, sir—go away; or I’ll knock your blamed
head off!” roared the Bald-head. “When I want a rat-trap
I shan’t patronise travelling vagabonds! Your audacity in
daring to put your hand on my head and wake me up
deserves a caning!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you don’t want a rat-trap?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, SIR!” yelled Bald-head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll make you one mighty cheap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll knock you down, sir!” roared Bald-head, looking
around for his cane.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, wall, I ain’t a starvin’, and it won’t make much
difference if I don’t sell to you!” remarked the stranger,
and he backed off and left the cabin for the promenade deck.</p>

<p class='c009'>An old maid sat in the shadow of the Texas, embroidering
a slipper, and the rat-trap man drew a stool up beside her
and remarked—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madam, my name is Baker, and I am the inventor of
the Eureky rat-trap, a sample copy of which I hold here on
my left hand, and I think I can safely say that——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, this is unpardonable!” she exclaimed, pushing
back.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“I didn’t have an introduction to ye, of course,” he
replied, holding the trap up higher: “but business is
business, you know. Let me sell you a Eureky trap, and
make ye happy for life; I warrant this trap to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, I shall call the captain!” she interrupted, turning
pale with rage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does <i>he</i> want a trap?” eagerly inquired the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such impudence deserves the horsewhip!” screamed the
old maid, backing away.</p>

<p class='c009'>The rat-trap man went forward and found a northern
invalid, who was so far gone that he could hardly speak
above a whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ailing, eh?” queried the trapper.</p>

<p class='c009'>The invalid nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, I won’t say that my Eureky rat-trap will cure ye,”
continued the man; “but this much I do say, and will swear
to on a million Bibles, that it climbs the ridge-pole over any
immortal vermin-booster ever yet set before——”</p>

<p class='c009'>The captain came up at this juncture, and informed the
inventor that he must quit annoying passengers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But some of ’em may want one o’ my Eureky traps,”
protested the man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can’t help it; this is no place to sell traps.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But this is no scrub trap—none o’ your humbugs, got
up to swindle the hair right off of an innocent and confiding
public.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You hear me—put that trap up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll put it up, of course; but then I’ll leave it to yerself
if it isn’t rather Shylocky in a steamboat to charge me the
reg’lar figger to Orleans, and then stop me from passing my
Eureky rat-trap out to the hankerin’ public?”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE SCHOOL EXAMINATION.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>THE bell tapped, and they came forth to battle. There
was the line, there was the leader. The great juncture
of the day was on him. Was not here the State’s official
eye? Did not victory hover overhead? His reserve, the
darling regiment, the flower of his army, was dressing for the
final charge. There was Claude. Next him, Sidonie!—and
Étienne, and Madelaine, Henri and Marcelline,—all waiting
for the word—the words—of eight syllables! Supreme
moment! Would any betray? Banish the thought!
Would any fail?</p>

<p class='c009'>He waited an instant while two or three mothers bore
out great armfuls of slumbering or fretting infancy, and a
number of young men sank down into the vacated chairs.
Then he stepped down from the platform, drew back four
or five yards from the class, opened the spelling-book,
scanned the first word, closed the book with his finger at
the place, lifted it high above his head, and cried—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Claude! Claude, my brave scholar, always perfect, ah
you ready?” He gave the little book a half whirl round,
and dashed forward towards the chosen scholar, crying as
he came—</p>

<p class='c009'>“In-e-rad-i-ca-bility!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Claude’s face suddenly set in a stony vacancy, and with
his eyes staring straight before him he responded—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I-n, in-, e, inerad-, r-a-d, rad-, inerad-, ineraddy-, ineradica-,
c-a, ca, ineradica-, ineradicabili-, b-i-elly- billy, ineradicabili-,
ineradicabili-, t-y, ty, ineradicability.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right! Claude, my boy! my always good scholar,
right!” The master drew back to his starting-place as he
spoke, re-opened the book, shut it again, lifted it high in
the air, cried, “Madelaine, my dear chile, prepare!” whirled
the book and rushed upon her with—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“In-de-fat-i-ga-bil-ly-ty!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Madelaine turned to stone, and began—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I-n, een, d-e, de-, inde-, indefat-, indefat—fat—f-a-t, fat,
indefat, indefatty, i, ty, indefati-, indefatiga-, g-a, ga, indefatiga-,
indefatigabilly, b-i-elly, billy, indefatigabili-, t-y, ty, indefatigability.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O, Madelaine, my chile, you make yo’ teacher proud!
prah-ood, my chile!” Bonaventure’s hand rested a moment
tenderly on her head as he looked first towards the audience
and then towards the stranger. Then he drew off for the third
word. He looked at it twice before he called it. Then—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sidonie! ah! Sidonie, be ready! be prepared! fail not
yo’ humble school-teacher! In-com——” He looked at
the word a third time, and then swept down upon her;
“In-com-pre-hen-si-ca-<i>bility</i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sidonie flinched not nor looked upon him, as he hung
over her with the spelling-book at arm’s reach above them;
yet the pause that followed seemed to speak dismay, and
throughout the class there was a silent recoil from something
undiscovered by the master. But an instant later
Sidonie had chosen between the two horns of her agonising
dilemma, and began—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I-n, een, c-o-m, cawm, eencawm, eencawmpre, p-r-e, pre,
eencawmpre, eencawmprehen, prehen, haich-e-n, hen, hen,
eencawmprehensi, s-i, si, eencawmprehensi-, bil——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! Sidonie! stop! <i>Arretez!</i> Si-do-nie-e-e-e! Oh!
listen—<i>écoutez</i>—Sidonie, my dear!” The master threw his
arms up and down in distraction, then suddenly faced the
visitor. “Sir, it was my blame! I spoke the word without
adequate distinction! Sidonie—<i>maintenant</i>—now!” But
a voice in the audience interrupted with—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Assoiez-vous la</i>, Chat-oué! seet down yondeh!” And at
the potent voice of Maximian Roussel the offender was
pushed silently into the seat he had risen from, and
Bonaventure gave the word again.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“In-com-pre-hen-si-ca-bil-i-ty!” And Sidonie, blushing
like fire, returned to the task.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I-n, een——” She bit her lips and trembled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right! <i>Right!</i> Tremble not, my Sidonie! fear
naught! yo’ loving school-teacher is at thy side!” But
she trembled like a red leaf as she spelled on—“Haich-e-n,
hen, eencawmprehen, eencawmprehensi, s-i, si, eencawmprehensi-,
eencawmprehensi-billy-t-y, ty, incomprehensibility!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The master dropped his hands and lifted his eyes in
speechless despair. As they fell again upon Sidonie her
own met them. She moaned, covered her face with her
hands, burst into tears, ran to her desk, and threw her
hands and face upon it, shaking with noiseless sobs and
burning red to the nape of her perfect neck. All Grande
Pointe rose to its feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lost!” cried Bonaventure in a heart-broken voice.
“Every thing lost! Farewell, chil’run!” He opened his
arms towards them, and with one dash all the lesser ones
filled them. They wept. Tears welled from Bonaventure’s
eyes; and the mothers of Grande Pointe dropped again into
their seats and silently added theirs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next moment all eyes were on Maximian. His
strong figure was mounted on a chair, and he was making
a gentle, commanding gesture with one hand as he called:
“Seet down! Seet down, all han’!” and all sank down,
Bonaventure in a mass of weeping and clinging children.
’Mian too resumed his seat, at the same time waving to the
stranger to speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My friends,” said the visitor, rising with alacrity, “I
say when a man makes a bargain, he ought to stick to it!”
He paused for them—as many as could—to take in the
meaning of his English speech, and, it may be, expecting
some demonstration of approval; but dead silence reigned,
all eyes on him save Bonaventure’s and Sidonie’s. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>began again: “A bargain’s a bargain!” And Chat-oué
nodded approvingly and began to say audibly, “Yass;”
but ’Mian thundered out—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Taise toi</i>, Chat-oué! Shot op!” And the silence was
again complete, while the stranger resumed—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“HE OPENED HIS ARMS, AND WITH ONE DASH ALL THE LESSER ONES FILLED THEM.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“There was a plain bargain made.” He moved a step
forward and laid the matter off on the palm of his hand.
“There was to be an examination! The school was not to
know; but if one scholar should make one mistake the
schoolhouse was to be closed and the schoolmaster sent
away. Well, there’s been a mistake made, and I say a
bargain’s a bargain.” Dead silence still. The speaker
looked at ’Mian. “Do you think they understand me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dey meck out,” said ’Mian, and shut his firm jaws.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My friends,” said the stranger once more, “some people
think education’s a big thing, and some think it ain’t. Well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>sometimes it is, and sometimes it ain’t. Now, here’s this
man”—he pointed down to where Bonaventure’s dishevelled
crown was drooping to his knees—“claims to have taught
over thirty of your children to read. Well, what of it? A
man can know how to read, and be just as no account as
he was before. He brags that he’s taught them to talk
English. Well, what does that prove? A man <i>might</i>
speak English and starve to death. He claims, I am told,
to have taught some of them to write. But I know a man
in the penitentiary that can write; he wrote too much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Bonaventure had lifted his head, and was sitting with his
eyes upon the speaker in close attention. At this last word
he said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! sir! too true, too true ah yo’ words; nevertheless,
their cooelty! ’Tis not what is print’ <i>in</i> the books, but
what you learn <i>through</i> the books!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; and so you hadn’t never ought to have made the
bargain you made; but, my friends, a bargain’s a bargain,
and the teacher’s——” He paused invitingly, and an answer
came from the audience. It was Catou who rose and said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naw, sah. Naw; he don’t got to go!” But again
’Mian thundered—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Taise toi</i>, Catou. Shot op!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say,” continued the stranger, “the mistake’s been
made. <i>Three</i> mistakes have been made!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yass!” roared Chat-oué, leaping to his feet and turning
upon the assemblage a face fierce with triumph. Suspense
and suspicions were past now; he was to see his desire on
his enemy. But instantly a dozen men were on their feet—St.
Pierre, Catou, Bonaventure himself, with a countenance
full of pleading deprecation, and even Claude, flushed with
anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Naw, sah! Naw, sah! Waun meesteck?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seet down, all han’!” yelled ’Mian; “all han’ seet dahoon!”
Only Chat-oué took his seat, glancing upon the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>with the exultant look of one who can afford to yield
ground.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The first mistake,” resumed the stranger, addressing himself
especially to the risen men still standing, and pointing
to Catou, “the first mistake was in the kind of bargain you
made.” He ceased, and passed his eyes around from one to
another until they rested for an instant on the bewildered
countenance of Chat-oué. Then he turned again upon the
people, who had sat down, and began to speak with the
exultation of a man that feels his subject lifting him above
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I came out here to show up that man as a fraud. But
what do I find?—A poor, unpaid, half-starved man that
loves his thankless work better than his life, teaching what not
one school-master in a thousand can teach: teaching his
whole school four better things than were ever printed in any
school-book—how to study, how to think, how to value
knowledge, and to love one another and mankind. What
you’d ought to have done was to agree that such a school
should keep open, and such a teacher should stay, if jest
one, one lone child should answer one single book-question
right! But, as I said before, a bargain’s a bargain——Hold
on, there! Sit down! You shan’t interrupt me again!”
Men were standing up on every side; there was a confusion
and a loud buzz of voices. “The second mistake,” the
stranger made haste to cry, “was thinking the teacher gave
out that last word right. He gave it wrong! And the
third mistake,” he shouted against the rising commotion,
“was thinking it was spelt wrong. <i>She spelt it right!</i>
And a bargain’s a bargain!—the school-master stays!”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“SEIZING HER HANDS IN HIS AS SHE TURNED TO FLY.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He could say no more; the rumble of voices suddenly
burst into a cheer. The women and children laughed
and clapped their hands,—Toutou his feet also,—and
Bonaventure, flirting the leaves of a spelling-book till he
found the place, looked, cried “In-com-pre-hen-<i>sibility</i>!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>wheeled and dashed upon Sidonie, seizing her hands in
his as she turned to fly, and gazed speechlessly upon
her, with the tears running down his face. Feeling a large
hand upon his shoulder, he glanced around and saw ’Mian
pointing him to his platform and desk. Thither he went.
The stranger had partly restored order. Every one was
in his place. But what a change! What a gay flutter
throughout the old shed! Bonaventure seemed to
have bathed in the fountain of youth. Sidonie, once more
the school’s queen-flower, sat calm, with just a trace of
tears adding a subtle something to her beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chil’run, beloved chil’run,” said Bonaventure, standing
once more by his desk, “yo’ school-teacher has the blame
of the sole mistake; and, sir, gladly, oh, gladly, sir, would
he always have the blame rather than any of his beloved
school-chil’run!”</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>WE always did pity a man who does not love childhood.
There is something morally wrong with such
a man. If his tenderest sympathies are not awakened by
their innocent prattle, if his heart does not echo their merry
laughter, if his whole nature does not reach out in ardent
longing after their pure thoughts and unselfish impulses, he
is a sour, crusty, crabbed old stick, and the world full of
children has no use for him. In every age and clime the
best and noblest men loved children. Even wicked men
have a tender spot left in their hardened hearts for little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>children. The great men of the earth love them. Dogs
love them. Kamehame Kemokimodahroah, the King of
the Cannibal Islands, loves them. Rare and no gravy.
Ah, yes, we all love children.</p>

<p class='c009'>And what a pleasure it is to talk with them! Who can
chatter with a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked, quick-witted little
darling, anywhere from three to five years, and not appreciate
the pride which swells a mother’s breast when she
sees her little ones admired? Ah, yes, to be sure.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day—ah, can we ever cease to remember that
dreamy, idle, summer afternoon—a lady friend, who was
down in the city on a shopping excursion, came into the
sanctum with her little son, a dear little tid-toddler of five
bright summers, and begged us to amuse him while she
pursued the duties which called her down town. Such a
bright boy; so delightful it was to talk to him. We can
never forget the blissful half-hour we spent booking that
prodigy up in his centennial history.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, listen, Clary,” we said—his name was Clarence
Fitzherbert Alencon de Marchemont Caruthers—“and learn
about George Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s he?” inquired Clarence, etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen,” we said; “he was the father of his country.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whose country?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ours—yours and mine; the confederated union of the
American people, cemented with the life-blood of the
men of ’76 poured out upon the altars of our country as the
dearest libation to liberty that her votaries can offer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who did?” asked Clarence.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a peculiar tact in talking to children that very
few people possess. Now most people would have grown
impatient, and lost their temper, when little Clarence asked
so many irrelevant questions, but we did not. We knew
that, however careless he might appear at first, we could
soon interest him in the story, and he would be all eyes and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>ears. So we smiled sweetly—that same sweet smile which
you may have noticed on our photographs. Just the faintest
ripple of a smile breaking across the face like a ray of sunlight,
and checked by lines of tender sadness, just before
the two ends of it pass each other at the back of the neck.
And so, smiling, we went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, one day George’s father——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George who?” asked Clarence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“George Washington. He was a little boy then, just
like you. One day his father——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whose father?” demanded Clarence, with an encouraging
expression of interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“George Washington’s—this great man we were telling
you of. One day George Washington’s father gave him a
little hatchet for a——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gave who a little hatchet?” the dear child interrupted
with a gleam of bewitching intelligence. Most men would
have betrayed signs of impatience, but we didn’t. We
know how to talk to children, so we went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“George Washington. His——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who gave him the little hatchet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His father. And his father——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whose father?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George Washington’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, George Washington. And his father told
him——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Told who?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Told George.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, George.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And we went on, just as patient and as pleasant as you
could imagine. We took up the story right where the boy
interrupted; for we could see that he was just crazy to hear
the end of it. We said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“And he told him that——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Who told him what?” Clarence broke in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, George’s father told George.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he tell him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, that’s just what I’m going to tell you. He told
him——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who told him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George’s father. He——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, so he wouldn’t do what he told him not to do.
He told him——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George told him?” queried Clarence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, his father told George——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; told him that he must be careful with the
hatchet——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who must be careful?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George must.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; must be careful with the hatchet——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What hatchet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, George’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; with the hatchet, and not cut himself with it, or
drop it in the cistern, or leave it out in the grass all night.
So George went round cutting everything he could reach
with his hatchet. At last he came to a splendid apple tree,
his father’s favourite, and cut it down and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who cut it down?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“——but his father came home and saw it the first
thing, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saw the hatchet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; saw the apple tree. And he said, ‘Who has cut
down my favourite apple tree?’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“What apple tree?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George’s father’s. And everybody said they didn’t
know anything about it, and——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Anything about what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The apple tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“——and George came up and heard them talking
about it——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heard who talking about it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Heard his father and the men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was they talking about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“About this apple tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What apple tree?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The favourite apple tree that George cut down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George who?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So George came up and heard them talking about it,
and he——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did he cut it down for?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just to try his little hatchet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whose little hatchet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, his own; the one his father gave him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gave who?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, George Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who gave it to him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His father did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So George came up and he said, ‘Father, I cannot tell
a lie. I——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who couldn’t tell a lie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, George Washington. He said, ‘Father, I cannot
tell a lie. It was——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His father couldn’t?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no; George couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Oh, George? Oh yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘—it was I cut down your apple tree. I did——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His father did?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no. It was George said this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Said he cut his father?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, no; said he cut down his apple tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George’s apple tree?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no; his father’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He said——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His father said?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, no; George said, ‘Father, I cannot tell a lie.
I did it with my little hatchet.’ And his father said,
‘Noble boy, I would rather lose a thousand trees than
have you tell a lie.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“George did?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; his father said that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Said he’d rather have a thousand apple trees?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no, no; said he’d rather lose a thousand apple
trees than——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Said he’d rather George would?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; said he’d rather he would than have him lie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, George would rather have his father lie?”</p>

<p class='c009'>We are patient, and we love children, but if Mrs.
Caruthers, of Arch Street, hadn’t come and got her prodigy
at this critical juncture, we don’t believe all Burlington
could have pulled us out of that snarl. And as Clarence
Fitzherbert Alencon de Marchemont Caruthers pattered
down the stairs, we heard him telling his ma about a boy
who had a father named George, and he told him to cut
down an apple tree, and he said he’d rather tell a thousand
lies than cut down one apple tree.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>SPEECH ON THE BABIES.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='c018'>[At the banquet, in Chicago, given by the army of the Tennessee to
their first commander, General U. S. Grant, November 1879. The
fifteenth regular toast was “The Babies—as they comfort us in our
sorrows, let us not forget them in our festivities.”]</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c019'>I&nbsp;LIKE that. We have not all had the good fortune to
be ladies. We have not all been generals, or poets, or
statesmen; but when the toast works down to the babies,
we stand on common ground. It is a shame that for a
thousand years the world’s banquets have utterly ignored
the baby, as if he didn’t amount to anything. If you will
stop and think a minute—if you will go back fifty or one
hundred years to your early married life, and recontemplate
your first baby—you will remember that he amounted to a
good deal, and even something over. You soldiers all
know that when that little fellow arrived at family headquarters
you had to hand in your resignation. He took
entire command. You became his lackey, his mere body-servant,
and you had to stand around too. He was not
a commander who made allowances for time, distance,
weather, or anything else. You had to execute his orders
whether it was possible or not. And there was only one
form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that was the
double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence
and disrespect, and the bravest of you didn’t dare say a
word. You could face the death-storm at Donelson and
Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he
clawed your whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted
your nose, you had to take it. When the thunders of war
were sounding in your ears, you set your faces toward the
batteries and advanced with steady tread; but when he
turned on the terrors of his war-whoop, you advanced in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the other direction, and mighty glad of the chance too.
When he called for soothing-syrup, did you venture to
throw out any side remarks about certain services being
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman? No. You got
up and <i>got</i> it. When he ordered his pap-bottle, and it was
not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work
and <i>warmed</i> it. You even descended so far in your menial
office as to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself,
to see if it was right—three parts water to one of milk, and
a touch of sugar to modify the colic, and a drop of peppermint
to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can taste the
stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went
along! Sentimental young folks still take stock in that
beautiful old saying, that when the baby smiles in his sleep,
it is because the angels are whispering to him. Very
pretty, but too thin—simply wind on the stomach, my
friends. If the baby proposed to take a walk at his usual
hour, two o’clock in the morning, didn’t you rise up
promptly and remark, with a mental addition which would
not improve a Sunday-school book <i>much</i>, that that was the
very thing you were about to propose yourself?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/ib046.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“ROCK-A-BY BABY IN THE TREE-TOP.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Oh! you were under good discipline, and as you went
fluttering up and down the room in your undress uniform,
you not only prattled undignified baby-talk, but even tuned
up your martial voices and tried to <i>sing</i>!—“Rock-a-by
baby in the tree-top,” for instance. What a spectacle for
an army of the Tennessee! And what an affliction for the
neighbours, too; for it is not everybody within a mile
around that likes military music at three in the morning.
And when you had been keeping this sort of thing up two
or three hours, and your little velvet-head intimated that
nothing suited him like exercise and noise, what did you
do? (“Go on!”) You simply <i>went</i> on until you dropped
in the last ditch. The idea that a <i>baby</i> doesn’t <i>amount</i> to
anything! Why, <i>one</i> baby is just a house and a front yard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>full by itself. <i>One</i> baby can furnish more business than
you and your whole Interior Department can attend to.
He is enterprising, irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities.
Do what you please, you can’t make him stay on the
reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long
as you are in your right mind don’t you ever pray for twins.
Twins amount to a permanent riot, and there ain’t any
real difference between triplets and an insurrection.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognise the
importance of the babies. Think what is in store for the
present crop! Fifty years from now we shall all be dead,
I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive (and let us
hope it may), will be floating over a Republic numbering
200,000,000 souls, according to the settled laws of our
increase. Our present schooner of State will have grown
into a political leviathan—a <i>Great Eastern</i>. The cradled
babies of to-day will be on deck. Let them be well trained,
for we are going to leave a big contract on their hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among the three or four million cradles now rocking in
the land are some which this nation would preserve for
ages as sacred things, if we could know which ones they
are. In one of these cradles the unconscious Farragut of
the future is at this moment teething—think of it!—and
putting in a world of dead earnest, unarticulated, but
perfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In another the
future renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky
Way with but a languid interest—poor little chap!—and
wondering what has become of that other one they call the
wet-nurse. In another the future great historian is lying—and
doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly mission
is ended. In another the future president is busying himself
with no profounder problem of state than what the
mischief has become of his hair so early; and in a mighty
array of other cradles there are now some 60,000 future
office-seekers, getting ready to furnish him occasion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>grapple with that same old problem a second time. And
in still one more cradle, somewhere under the flag, the
future illustrious commander-in-chief of the American
armies is so little burdened with his approaching grandeurs
and responsibilities as to be giving his whole strategic mind
at this moment to trying to find out some way to get his
big toe into his mouth—an achievement which, meaning
no disrespect, the illustrious guest of this evening turned
<i>his</i> entire attention to some fifty-six years ago; and if the
child is but a prophecy of the man, there are mighty few
who will doubt that he <i>succeeded</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>ON CYCLONES.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I&nbsp;DESIRE to state
that my position as
United States cyclonist
for this judicial district
is now vacant. I resigned
on the 9th day of September, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1884.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have not the necessary personal magnetism to look a
cyclone in the eye and make it quail. I am stern and even
haughty in my intercourse with men, but when a Manitoba
simoon takes me by the brow of my pantaloons and throws
me across township 28, range 18, west of the 5th principal
meridian, I lose my mental reserve and become anxious
and even taciturn. For thirty years I had yearned to see a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>grown-up cyclone, of the ring-tail-puller variety, mop up the
green earth with huge forest trees and make the landscape
look tired. On the 9th day of September, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1884, my
morbid curiosity was gratified.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the people came out into the forest with lanterns and
pulled me out of the crotch of a basswood tree with a
“tackle and fall,” I remember I told them I didn’t yearn
for any more atmospheric phenomena.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old desire for a hurricane that could blow a cow
through a penitentiary was satiated. I remember when the
doctor pried the bones of my leg together, in order to kind
of draw my attention away from the limb, he asked me how
I liked the fall style of zephyr in that locality.</p>

<p class='c009'>I said it was all right, what there was of it. I said this
in a tone of bitter irony.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cyclones are of two kinds—viz., the dark maroon cyclone,
and the iron grey cyclone with pale green mane and tail.
It was the latter kind I frolicked with on the above-named
date.</p>

<p class='c009'>My brother and I were riding along in the grand old
forest, and I had just been singing a few bars from the
opera of “Whoop ’em up, Lizzie Jane,” when I noticed
that the wind was beginning to sough through the trees.
Soon after that I noticed that I was soughing through the
trees also, and I am really no slouch of a sougher either
when I get started.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horse was hanging by the breeching from the bough
of a large butternut tree, waiting for some one to come and
pick him.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not see my brother at first, but after a while he
disengaged himself from a rail fence, and came where I was
hanging, wrong end up, with my personal effects spilling
out of my pockets. I told him that as soon as the wind
kind of softened down, I wished he would go and pick the
horse. He did so, and at midnight a party of friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>carried me into town on a stretcher. It was quite an
ovation. To think of a torchlight procession coming out
way out there into the woods at midnight, and carrying
me into town on their shoulders in triumph! And yet I
was once a poor boy!</p>

<p class='c009'>It shows what may be accomplished by any one if he
will persevere and insist on living a different life.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cyclone is a natural phenomenon, enjoying the most
robust health. It may be a pleasure for a man with great
will power and an iron constitution to study more carefully
into the habits of the cyclone, but as far as I am concerned,
individually, I could worry along some way if we didn’t
have a phenomenon in the house from one year’s end to
another.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I sit here, with my leg in a silicate of soda corset, and
watch the merry throng promenading down the street, or
mingling in the giddy torchlight procession, I cannot
repress a feeling toward a cyclone that almost amounts to
disgust.</p>

<div class='c020'><span class='sc'>Washington</span>, D.C., <i>March 20, 1861</i>.</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>JUDGE not by appearances, for appearances are very
deceptive,—as the old lady cholerically remarked
when one, who was really a virgin unto forty, blushingly
informed her that she was “just twenty-five this month.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Though you find me in Washington now, I was born
of respectable parents, and gave every indication, in my
satchel and apron days, of coming to something better than
this.</p>

<p class='c009'>Slightly northward of the Connecticut river, where a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>pleasant little conservative village mediates between two
opposition hills, you may behold the landscape on which
my infantile New England eyes first traced the courses of
future railroads.</p>

<p class='c009'>Near the centre of this village in the valley, and a little
back from its principal road, stood the residence of my
worthy sire, and a very pretty residence it was. From the
frequent addition of a new upper room here, a new dormer
window there, and an innovating skylight elsewhere, the
roof of the mansion had gradually assumed an alpine
variety of juts and peaks somewhat confusing to behold.
Local tradition related that, on a certain showery occasion,
a streak of lightning was seen to descend upon that roof,
skip vaguely about from one peak to another, and finally
slink ignominiously down the water-pipe, as though utterly
disgusted with its own inability to determine, where there
were so many, which peak it should particularly perforate.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the house in which I came to life a certain
number of years ago, entering the world like a human
exclamation point between two of the angriest sentences
of a September storm, and adding materially to the uproar
prevailing at the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next to my parents, the person I can best remember, as
I look back, was our family physician. A very obese man
was he, with certain sweet-oiliness of manner, and never
put out of patience. I think I can see him still, as he arose
from his chair after a profound study of the case before him,
and wrote a prescription so circumlocutory in its effect that
it sent a servant half-a-mile to his friend the druggist for
articles she might have found in her own kitchen, <i>aqua
pumpaginis</i> and sugar being the sole ingredients required.</p>

<p class='c009'>The doctor had started business in our village as a
veterinary surgeon, but as the entire extent of his practice
for six months in that line was a call to mend one of Colt’s
revolvers, he finally turned his attention to the ailings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>his fellows, and wrought many cures with sugar and water
latinised.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first, my father did not patronise the new doctor,
having very little faith in the efficacy of sugar and water,
without the addition of certain other composites often seen
in bottles; but the doctor’s neat speech at a Sunday-school
festival won his heart at last. The festival was held near a
series of small water-falls just out of the village, and the
doctor, who was an invited guest, was called upon for a
few appropriate remarks. In compliance with the demand,
he made a speech of some compass, ending with a peroration
that is still quoted in my native place. He pointed impressively
to the water-falls, and says he—</p>

<p class='c009'>“All the works of nature is somewhat beautiful, with a
good moral. Even them cataracts,” says he sagely, “have
a moral, and seems eternally whispering to the young, that
‘those what err falls.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>The effect of this happy illustration was very pleasing, my
boy; especially with those who prefer morality to grammar;
and after that the physician had the run of all the pious
families—our own included.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a handsome compliment this worthy man paid me
when I was about six months old. Having just received
from my father the amount of his last bill, he was complacent
to the last degree, and felt inclined to do the
handsome thing. He patted my head as I sat upon my
mother’s lap, and says he—</p>

<p class='c009'>“How beautiful is babes! So small and yet so much
like human beings, only not so large. This boy,” says he
fatly, looking down at me, “will make a noise in the world
yet. He has a long head, a very long head.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you think so?” says my father.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I do,” says the doctor. “The little fellow,”
says he in a sudden fit of abstraction, “has a long head, a
very long head—and it’s as thick as it is long.”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“AND IT’S AS THICK AS IT IS LONG.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There was some coolness between the doctor and my
father after that, and on the following Sunday my mother
refused to look at his wife’s new bonnet in church.</p>

<p class='c009'>So far as I can trace back, we never had a literary
character in our family, save a venerable aunt of mine, on
my mother’s side, who commenced her writing career by
refusing to contribute to the Sunday papers, and subsequently
won much fame as the authoress of a set of copy-books.
When this gifted relative found herself acquiring a
reputation she came in state to visit us, and so disgusted
my very practical father, by wearing slipshod gaiters, inking
her right-hand thumb-nail every morning, calling all things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>by European names, and insisting upon giving our oldest
plough-horse the romantic and literary title of “Lord
Byron,” that my exasperated parent incurred a most
tremendous prejudice against authorship, and vowed, when
she went away, that he never would invite her presence
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was only twenty years old at that time, and the novelty
of my aunt’s conduct had a rather infatuating effect upon
me. With the perversity often observable in youngsters
before they have seen much of the world, I became deeply
interested in my literary relative as soon as my father began
speaking contemptuously of her pursuits, and it took very
little time to invest me with a longing and determination
to be a writer.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thenceforth I wore negligent linen; frequently rested
my head upon the forefinger of my right hand, with a lofty
and abstracted air; assumed an expression of settled and
mysterious gloom when at church, and suffered my hair to
grow long and uncombed.</p>

<p class='c009'>My bearing during this period of infatuation could hardly
fail to attract considerable attention in our village, and
there were two opinions about me. One was that I had
been jilted; the other that I was likely to become a
vagabond and an actor. My father inclined to the former,
and left me, as he thought, to get over my disappointment
in the natural way.</p>

<p class='c009'>My peripatetic spell had lasted about six weeks, when I
formed the acquaintance of the editor of the <i>Lily of the
Valley</i>, who permitted me to mope in his office now and
then, and soothed my literary inflammation by allowing me
to write “puffs” for the village milliner.</p>

<p class='c009'>While looking over some old magazines in the <i>Lily</i> office
one day, I found in an ancient British periodical a raking
article upon American literature, wherein the critic affirmed
that all our writers were but weak imitators of English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>authors, and that such a thing as a Distinctly American
Poem, <i>sui generis</i>, had not yet been produced.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This radical sneer at the United States of America fired
my Yankee blood, and I vowed within myself to write a
poem, not only distinctively American, but of such a
character that only America could have produced it. In
the solitude of my room, that night, I wooed the aboriginal
muse, and two days thereafter the <i>Lily of the Valley</i> contained
my distinctive American poem of</p>

<p class='c013'>In his note introductory of this poem the editor of the

(which was strictly true), and ventured the belief that the
composition would remind his readers of Goldsmith.
Upon which his scorpion contemporary in the next village
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>observed that there was rather more smith than gold about
the poem.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to the time when this poem appeared in print, I had
succeeded in concealing from my father the nature of my
incidental occupation; but now he must know all.</p>

<p class='c009'>He <i>did</i> know all; and the result was that he gave me ten
dollars, and sent me to New York to look out for myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the only thing that will save him,” says he to my
mother; “and I must either send him off or expect to
see him sink by degrees to editorship and begin wearing
disgraceful clothes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to New York; I became private secretary and
speech-scribe to an unscrupulous and, therefore, rising
politician, and now I am in Washington.</p>

came hither; but war’s alarms indicate that I may do better

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE MINISTER’S WOOING.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_35_0_65 c008'>“WAL, the upshot on’t was, they fussed and fuzzled
and wuzzled till they’d drinked up all the tea
in the tea-pot; and then they went down and called
on the parson, and wuzzled him all up talkin’ about this,
that, and t’other that wanted lookin’ to, and that it was
no way to leave everything to a young chit like Huldy,
and that he ought to be lookin’ about for an experienced
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The parson, he thanked ’em kindly, and said he believed
their motives was good, but he didn’t go no further.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He didn’t ask Mis’ Pipperidge to come and stay there
and help him, nor nothin’ o’ that kind; but he said he’d
attend to matters himself. The fact was, the parson had
got such a likin’ for havin’ Huldy ’round, that he couldn’t
think o’ such a thing as swappin’ her off for the Widder
Pipperidge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘But,’ he thought to himself, ‘Huldy is a good girl;
but I oughtn’t to be a leavin’ everything to her—it’s too
hard on her. I ought to be instructin’ and guidin’ and
helpin’ of her; ’cause ’tain’t everybody could be expected to
know and do what Mis’ Carryl did;’ and so at it he went;
and Lordy massy! didn’t Huldy hev a time on’t when the
minister began to come out of his study, and wanted to ten
’round and see to things? Huldy, you see, thought all the
world of the minister, and she was ’most afraid to laugh;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>but she told me she couldn’t, for the life of her, help it
when his back was turned, for he wuzzled things up
in the most singular way. But Huldy, she’d jest say,
‘Yes, sir,’ and get him off into his study, and go on her
own way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Huldy,’ says the minister one day, ‘you ain’t
experienced out doors; and when you want to know anything,
you must come to me.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Yes, sir,’ said Huldy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Now, Huldy,’ says the parson, ‘you must be sure to
save the turkey eggs, so that we can have a lot of turkeys
for Thanksgiving.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Yes, sir,’ says Huldy; and she opened the pantry-door,
and showed him a nice dishful she’d been a savin’ up. Wal,
the very next day the parson’s hen-turkey was found killed
up to old Jim Scroggs’s barn. Folks say Scroggs killed it;
though Scroggs, he stood to it he didn’t; at any rate, the
Scroggses, they made a meal on’t, and Huldy, she felt bad
about it ’cause she’d set her heart on raisin’ the turkeys;
and says she, ‘Oh, dear! I don’t know what I shall do, I
was just ready to set her.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Do, Huldy?’ says the parson: ‘why, there’s the
other turkey, out there by the door; and a fine bird, too,
he is.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure enough, there was the old tom-turkey a-struttin’ and
a-sidlin’, and a-quitterin’, and a-floutin’ his tail feathers in
the sun, like a lively young widower, all ready to begin life
over again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘But,’ says Huldy, ‘you know <i>he</i> can’t set on eggs.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘He can’t? I’d like to know why,’ says the parson.
‘He <i>shall</i> set on eggs, and hatch ’em too.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh, doctor!’ says Huldy, all in a tremble; ’cause, you
know, she didn’t want to contradict the minister, and she
was afraid she should laugh—‘I never heard that a tom-turkey
would set on eggs.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“‘Why, they ought to,’ said the parson, getting quite ’arnest.
‘What else be they good for? You just bring out the eggs,
now, and put ’em in the nest, and I’ll make him set on ’em.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, Huldy, she thought there weren’t no way to convince
him but to let him try: so she took the eggs out, and fixed
’em all nice in the nest; and then she come back and found
old Tom a-skirmishin’ with the parson pretty lively, I tell
ye. Ye see, old Tom, he didn’t take the idee at all; and
he flopped and gobbled, and fit the parson: and the
parson’s wig got ’round so that his cue stuck straight out
over his ear, but he’d got his blood up. Ye see, the old
doctor was used to carryin’ his p’ints o’ doctrine; and he
hadn’t fit the Arminians and Socinians to be beat by a tom-turkey;
and finally he made a dive and ketched him by the
neck in spite o’ his floppin’, and stroked him down, and put
Huldy’s apron ’round him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘There, Huldy,’ he says, quite red in the face, ‘we’ve
got him now;’ and he travelled off to the barn with him as
lively as a cricket.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huldy came behind, just chokin’ with laugh, and afraid
the minister would look ’round and see her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Now, Huldy, we’ll crook his legs, and set him down,’
says the parson, when they got him to the nest; ‘you see
he is getting quiet, and he’ll set there all right.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the parson, he sot him down; and old Tom, he
sot there solemn enough and held his head down all
droopin’, lookin’ like a rail pious old cock, as long as the
parson sot by him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘There: you see how still he sets,’ says the parson to
Huldy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huldy was ’most dyin’ for fear she should laugh.
‘I’m afraid he’ll get up,’ says she, ‘when you do.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh no, he won’t!’ says the parson, quite confident.
‘There, there,’ says he, layin’ his hands on him as if pronouncin’
a blessin’.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“But when the parson riz up, old Tom, he riz up too, and
began to march over the eggs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Stop, now!’ says the parson. ‘I’ll make him get
down agin; hand me that corn-basket; we’ll put that over
him.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“So he crooked old Tom’s legs, and got him down agin;
and they put the corn-basket over him, and then they both
stood and waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘That’ll do the thing, Huldy,’ said the parson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I don’t know about it,’ says Huldy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh yes, it will, child; I understand,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as he spoke, the basket riz right up and stood, and
they could see old Tom’s long legs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I’ll make him stay down, confound him,’ says the
parson, for you see, parsons is men, like the rest on us, and
the doctor had got his spunk up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘You jist hold him a minute, and I’ll get something
that’ll make him stay, I guess;’ and out he went to the
fence, and brought in a long, thin, flat stone, and laid it on
old Tom’s back.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh, my eggs!’ says Huldy. ‘I’m afraid he’s smashed
’em!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“And sure enough, there they was, smashed flat enough
under the stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I’ll have him killed,’ said the parson. ‘We won’t have
such a critter ’round.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wal, next week, Huldy, she jist borrowed the minister’s
horse and side-saddle, and rode over to South Parish to her
Aunt Bascome’s,—Widder Bascome’s, you know, that lives
there by the trout-brook,—and got a lot o’ turkey eggs o’
her, and come back and set a hen on ’em, and said nothin’;
and in good time there was as nice a lot o’ turkey-chicks as
ever ye see.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huldy never said a word to the minister about his
experiment, and he never said a word to her; but he sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>o’ kep’ more to his books, and didn’t take it on him to
advise so much.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not long arter he took it into his head that Huldy
ought to have a pig to be a fattin’ with the buttermilk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mis’ Pipperidge set him up to it; and jist then old Tom
Bigelow, out to Juniper Hill, told him if he’d call over he’d
give him a little pig.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So he sent for a man, and told him to build a pig-pen
right out by the well, and have it all ready when he came
home with his pig.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huldy said she wished he might put a curb round the
well out there, because, in the dark sometimes, a body
might stumble into it; and the parson said he might do
that.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wal, old Aikin, the carpenter, he didn’t come till ’most
the middle of the arternoon; and then he sort o’ idled, so
that he didn’t get up the well-curb till sundown; and then
he went off, and said he’d come and do the pig-pen next
day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wal, arter dark, Parson Carryl, he driv into the yard,
full chizel, with his pig.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘There, Huldy, I’ve got you a nice little pig.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Dear me!’ says Huldy; ‘where have you put him?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Why, out there in the pig-pen, to be sure.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh, dear me!’ says Huldy, ‘that’s the well-curb—there
ain’t no pig-pen built,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Lordy massy!’ says the parson; ‘then I’ve thrown the
pig in the well!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wal, Huldy, she worked and worked, and finally she
fished piggy out in the bucket, but he was as dead as a
door-nail; and she got him out o’ the way quietly, and
didn’t say much; and the parson he took to a great Hebrew
book in his study.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Arter that the parson set sich store by Huldy that he
come to her and asked her about everything, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>amazin’ how everything she put her hand to prospered.
Huldy planted marigolds and larkspurs, pinks and carnations,
all up and down the path to the front door; and
trained up mornin’ glories and scarlet runners round the
windows. And she was always gettin’ a root here, and a
sprig there, and a seed from somebody else; for Huldy was
one o’ them that has the gift, so that ef you jist give ’em the
leastest of anything they make a great bush out of it right
away; so that in six months Huldy had roses and geraniums
and lilies, sich as it would take a gardener to raise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Huldy was so sort o’ chipper and fair spoken, that she
got the hired men all under her thumb: they come to her
and took her orders jist as meek as so many calves; and
she traded at the store, and kep’ the accounts, and she had
her eyes everywhere, and tied up all the ends so tight that
there wa’n’t no gettin’ ’round her. She wouldn’t let nobody
put nothin’ off on Parson Carryl ’cause he was a minister.
Huldy was allers up to anybody that wanted to make a hard
bargain, and, afore he knew jist what he was about, she’d
got the best end of it, and everybody said that Huldy was
the most capable girl they ever traded with.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wal, come to the meetin’ of the Association, Mis’
Deakin Blodgett, and Mis’ Pipperidge come callin’ up to the
parson’s all in a stew, and offerin’ their services to get the
house ready, but the doctor, he jist thanked ’em quite quiet,
and turned ’em over to Huldy; and Huldy she told ’em
that she’d got everything ready, and showed ’em her
pantries, and her cakes, and her pies, and her puddin’s, and
took ’em all over the house; and they went peekin’ and
pokin’, openin’ cupboard doors, and lookin’ into drawers;
and they couldn’t find so much as a thread out o’ the way,
from garret to cellar, and so they went off quite discontented.
Arter that the women set a new trouble a-brewin’. They
begun to talk that it was a year now since Mis’ Carryl
died; and it r’ally wasn’t proper such a young gal to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>stayin’ there, who everybody could see was a-settin’ her cap
for the minister.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mis’ Pipperidge said, that so long as she looked on
Huldy as the hired gal, she hadn’t thought much about
it; but Huldy was railly takin’ on airs as an equal, and
appearin’ as mistress o’ the house in a way that would make
talk if it went on. And Mis’ Pipperidge she driv’ ’round
up to Deakin Abner Snow’s, and down to Mis’ ’Lijah
Perry’s, and asked them if they wasn’t afraid that the way
the parson and Huldy was a-goin’ on might make talk.
And they said they hadn’t thought on’t before, but now,
come to think on’t, they was sure it would; and they all
went and talked with somebody else, and asked them if they
didn’t think it would make talk. So come Sunday, between
meetin’s there warn’t nothin’ else talked about; and Huldy
saw folks a-noddin’ and a-winkin’, and a-lookin’ arter her,
and she begun to feel drefful sort o’ disagreeable. Finally
Mis’ Sawin, she says to her, ‘My dear, didn’t you never
think folk would talk about you and the minister?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Wal, dear,’ says she, ‘I think it’s a shame; but

<p class='c009'>“Huldy was a gal of spirit, and she despised the talk,
but it made her drefful uncomfortable; and when she got

quite quiet, and didn’t sing a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The minister he had heard the same thing from one of

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh, sir!’ says Huldy, ‘<i>is</i> it improper for me to be

can to make you happy. Will you?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wal, Huldy never told me just what she said to the

and the hull on’t was, that Huldy she did a consid’able
lot o’ clear starchin’ and ironin’ the next two days; and the

together to Dr. Lothrop’s, in Oldtown; and the doctor, he

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I&nbsp;HAVE a passion for fat women. If there is anything I
hate in life, it is what dainty people call a <i>spirituelle</i>.
Motion—rapid motion—a smart, quick, squirrel-like step, a
pert, voluble tone—in short, a lively girl—is my exquisite
horror. I would as lief have a <i>diable petit</i> dancing his
infernal hornpipe on my cerebellum as to be in a room with
one. I have tried before now to school myself into liking
these parched peas of humanity. I have followed them with
my eyes, and attended to their rattle till I was as crazy as a
fly in a drum. I have danced with them, and romped with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>them in the country, and perilled the salvation of my
“white tights,” by sitting near them at supper. I swear off
from this moment. I do. I won’t—no—hang me if ever
I show another small, lively, <i>spry</i> woman a civility.</p>

<p class='c009'>Albina McLush is divine. She is like the description of
the Persian beauty by Hafiz: “Her heart is full of passion,
and her eyes are full of sleep.” She is the sister of Lurly
McLush, my old college chum, who, as early as his
sophomore year, was chosen president of the Dolcefarniente
Society, no member of which was ever known to be
surprised at anything—(the college law of rising before
breakfast excepted). Lurly introduced me to his sister
one day, as he was lying upon a heap of turnips, leaning on
his elbow with his head in his hand, in a green lane in the
suburbs. He had driven over a stump, and been tossed
out of his gig, and I came up just as he was wondering how
in the d—l’s name he got there. Albina sat quietly in the
gig, and when I was presented, requested me, with a
delicious drawl, to say nothing about the adventure—“it
would be so troublesome to relate it to everybody!” I
loved her from that moment. Miss McLush was tall,
and her shape, of its kind, was perfect. It was not a
fleshy one exactly, but she was large and full. Her skin
was clear, fine-grained and transparent; her temples and
forehead perfectly rounded and polished, and her lips and
chin swelling into a ripe and tempting pout, like the cleft of
a burst apricot. And then her eyes—large, languid, and
sleepy—they languished beneath their long, black fringes as
if they had no business with daylight—like two magnificent
dreams, surprised in their jet embryos by some bird-nesting
cherub. Oh! it was lovely to look into them!</p>

<p class='c009'>She sat usually upon a <i>fauteuil</i>, with her large, full arm
embedded in the cushion, sometimes for hours without
stirring. I have seen the wind lift the masses of dark hair
from her shoulders, when it seemed like the coming to life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of a marble Hebe—she had been motionless so long. She
was a model for a goddess of sleep; as she sat with her
eyes half-closed, lifting up their superb lips slowly as you
spoke to her, and dropping them again with the deliberate
motion of a cloud, when she had murmured out her syllable
of assent. Her figure, in a sitting posture, presented a
gentle declivity from the curve of her neck to the instep of
the small round foot lying on its side upon the ottoman.
I remember a fellow bringing her a plate of fruit one
evening. He was one of your lively men—a horrid
monster, all right angles and activity. Having never been
accustomed to hold her own plate, she had not well extracted
her whole fingers from her handkerchief before he set it
down in her lap. As it began slowly to slide towards her
feet, her hand relapsed into the muslin folds, and she fixed
her eyes upon it with a kind of indolent surprise, drooping
her lids gradually, till, as the fruit scattered over the
ottoman, they closed entirely, and a liquid jet line was
alone visible through the heavy lashes. There was an
imperial indifference in it worthy of Juno.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss McLush rarely walks. When she does it is with the
deliberate majesty of a Dido. Her small, plump feet melt
to the ground like snow-flakes, and her figure sways to the
indolent motion of her limbs with a glorious grace and
yieldingness quite indescribable. She was idling slowly up
the Mall one evening, just at twilight, with a servant at a
short distance behind her, who, to while away the time
between her steps, was employing himself in throwing
stones at the cows feeding upon the common. A gentleman,
with a natural admiration for her splendid person,
addressed her. He might have done a more eccentric
thing. Without troubling herself to look at him, she turned
to her servant and requested him, with a yawn of desperate
<i>ennui</i>, to knock that fellow down! John obeyed his orders;
and, as his mistress resumed her lounge, picked up a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>handful of pebbles, and tossing one at the nearest cow,
loitered lazily after.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such supreme indolence was irresistible. I gave in—I
who never before could summon energy to sigh—I to whom a
declaration was but a synonym for perspiration—I—who had
only thought of love as a nervous complaint, and of women
but to pray for a good deliverance—I—yes—I knocked
under. Albina McLush! thou wert too exquisitely lazy.
Human sensibilities cannot hold out for ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>I found her one morning sipping her coffee at twelve, with
her eyes wide open. She was just from the bath, and her
complexion had a soft, dewy transparency, like the cheek of
Venus rising from the sea. It was the hour, Lurly had told
me, when she would be at the trouble of thinking. She put
away with her dimpled forefinger, as I entered, a cluster of
rich curls that had fallen over her face, and nodded to me
like a water-lily swaying to the wind when its cup is full of
rain. “Lady Albina,” said I, in my softest tone, “how
are you to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beltina,” said she, addressing her maid in a voice as
clouded and rich as a south wind on an Æolian, “how am
I to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The conversation fell into short sentences, and the
dialogue became monologue. I entered upon my declaration
with the assistance of Beltina, who supplied her
mistress with cologne. I kept her attention alive through
the incipient circumstances. Symptoms were soon told.
I came to the avowal. Her hand lay reposing on the arm
of the sofa, half buried in a muslin <i>foulard</i>. I took it up.
I pressed the cool, soft fingers to my lips—unforbidden.
I rose and looked into her eyes for confirmation. Delicious
creature! she was asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never have had courage to renew the subject. Miss
McLush seems to have forgotten it altogether. Upon
reflection, too, I am convinced she would not survive the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>excitement of the ceremony, unless, indeed, she should sleep
between the responses and the prayer. I am still devoted,
however, and if there should come a war or an earthquake,
or if the millennium should commence, as it is expected, in
1833, or if anything happens that can keep her waking so
long, I shall deliver a declaration abbreviated for me by a
scholar friend of mine, which he warrants may be articulated
in fifteen minutes—without fatigue.</p>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘PROFESSOR,’ I SAID, ‘YOU ARE INEBRIATED.’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>YOU haven’t heard about my friend the Professor’s first
experiment in the use of anæsthetics, have you?</p>

<p class='c009'>He was mightily pleased with the reception of that poem
of his about the chaise. He spoke to me once or twice
about another poem of similar character he wanted to read
me, which I told him I would listen to and criticise.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day, after dinner, he came in with his face tied up,
looking very red in the cheeks, and heavy about the eyes.
“Hy ’r’ ye?” he said, and made for an arm-chair, in which
he placed first his hat and then his person, going smack
through the crown of the former, as neatly as they do the
trick at the circus.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Professor jumped at the explosion as if he had sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>down on one of those small <i>calthrops</i> our grandfathers used
to sow round in the grass when there were Indians about,—iron
stars, each ray a rusty thorn an inch and a half long,—stick
through moccasins into feet,—cripple ’em on the spot,
and give ’em lock-jaw in a day or two.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time he let off one of those big words which
lie at the bottom of the best man’s vocabulary, but perhaps
never turn up in his life,—just as every man’s hair <i>may</i>
stand on end, but in most men it never does. After he had
got calm, he pulled out a sheet or two of manuscript,
together with a smaller scrap, on which, as he said, he had
just been writing an introduction or prelude to the main
performance. A certain suspicion had come into my mind
that the Professor was not quite right, which was confirmed
by the way he talked; but I let him begin.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is the way he read it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in7'>“<span class='sc'>Prelude.</span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m the fellah that tole one day</div>
      <div class='line'>The tale of the won’erful one-hoss shay.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wan’ to hear another? Say,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Funny, wasn’t it? Made <i>me</i> laugh,—</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m too modest, I am, by half,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Made me laugh ’s <i>though I sh’d split</i>,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Cahn’ a fellah like fellah’s own wit?—</div>
      <div class='line'>Fellah’s keep sayin’, ‘Well, now, that’s nice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Did it once, but cahn’ do it twice,’—</div>
      <div class='line'>Dön’ you believe thee ’z no more fat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lots in the kitch’n ’z good ’z that.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fus’-rate throw, ’n’ no mistake,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Han’ us the props for another shake;</div>
      <div class='line'>Know I’ll try, ’n’ guess I’ll win;</div>
      <div class='line'>Here sh’ goes for hit ’m ag’in!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Here I thought it necessary to interpose. “Professor,”
I said, “you are inebriated. The style of what you call
your ‘Prelude’ shows that it was written under cerebral
excitement. Your articulation is confused. You have told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>me three times in succession, in exactly the same words,
that I was the only true friend you had in the world that
you would unbutton your heart to. You smell distinctly
and decidedly of spirits.” I spoke and paused; tender
but firm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two large tears orbed themselves beneath the Professor’s
lids,—in obedience to the principles of gravitation celebrated
in that delicious bit of bladdery bathos, “The very
law that moulds a tear,” with which the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
attempted to put down Master George Gordon when that
young man was foolishly trying to make himself conspicuous.
One of these tears peeped over the edge of the lid until it
lost its balance,—slid an inch and waited for reinforcements,—swelled
again,—rolled down a little further,—stopped,—moved
on,—and at last fell on the back of the Professor’s
hand. He held it up for me to look at, and lifted
his eyes, brimful, till they met mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>I couldn’t stand it,—I always break down when folks cry
in my face,—so I hugged him, and said he was a dear old
boy, and asked him kindly what was the matter with him,
and what made him smell so dreadfully strong of spirits.
Upset his alcohol lamp,—he said,—and spilt the alcohol on
his legs. That was it. But what had he been doing to get
his head into such a state—had he really committed an
excess? What was the matter? Then it came out that he
had been taking chloroform to have a tooth out, which had
left him in a very queer state, in which he had written the
“Prelude” given above, and under the influence of which
he evidently was still.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“I HANDED HIM THE TICKET, WITH A LITTLE BOW OF DEFERENCE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>FOR twenty years and over, our good parson had been toiling,</p>
<p class='c023'>To chip the bad meat from our hearts, and keep the good from spoiling;</p>
<p class='c023'>But suddenly he wilted down, and went to looking sickly,</p>
<p class='c023'>And the doctor said that something must be put up for him quickly.</p>
<p class='c023'>So we kind o’ clubbed together, each according to his notion,</p>
<p class='c023'>And bought a circular ticket, in the lands across the ocean;</p>
<p class='c023'>Wrapped some pocket-money in it—what we thought would easy do him—</p>
<p class='c023'>And appointed me committee-man, to go and take it to him.</p>
<p class='c023'>I found him in his study, looking rather worse than ever;</p>
<p class='c023'>And told him ’twas decided that his flock and he should sever.</p>
<p class='c023'>Then his eyes grew big with wonder, and it seemed almost to blind ’em,</p>
<p class='c023'>And some tears looked out o’ window, with some others close behind ’em!</p>
<p class='c023'>But I handed him the ticket, with a little bow of deference,</p>
<p class='c023'>And he studied quite a little ere he got the proper reference,</p>
<p class='c023'>And then the tears that waited—great unmanageable creatures—</p>
<p class='c023'>Let themselves quite out o’ window, and came climbing down his features.</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<p class='c023'>I wish you could ha’ seen him when he came back, fresh and glowing,</p>
<p class='c023'>His clothes all worn and seedy, and his face all fat and knowing;</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>I wish you could ha’ heard him, when he prayed for us who sent him,</p>
<p class='c023'>Paying back with compound int’rest every dollar that we’d lent him!</p>
<p class='c023'>’Twas a feast to true believers—’twas a blight on contradiction—</p>
<p class='c023'>To hear one just from Calvary talk about the crucifixion;</p>
<p class='c023'>’Twas a damper on those fellows who pretended they could doubt it,</p>
<p class='c023'>To have a man who’d been there stand and tell ’em all about it!</p>
<p class='c023'>Why every foot of Scripture, whose location used to stump us,</p>
<p class='c023'>Was now regularly laid out with the different points o’ compass;</p>
<p class='c023'>When he undertook a subject, in what nat’ral lines he’d draw it!</p>
<p class='c023'>He would paint it out so honest that it seemed as if you saw it.</p>
<p class='c023'>And the way he went for Europe! oh, the way he scampered through it!</p>
<p class='c023'>Not a mountain but he clim’ it—not a city but he knew it;</p>
<p class='c023'>There wasn’t any subject to explain, in all creation,</p>
<p class='c023'>But he could go to Europe, and bring back an illustration!</p>
<p class='c023'>So we crowded out to hear him, quite instructed and delighted;</p>
<p class='c023'>’Twas a picture-show, a lecture, and a sermon—all united;</p>
<p class='c023'>And my wife would rub her glasses, and serenely pet her Test’ment,</p>
<p class='c023'>And whisper, “That ere ticket was a splendid good investment.”</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<p class='c023'>Now, after six months’ travel, we was most of us all ready</p>
<p class='c023'>To settle down a little, so’s to live more staid and steady;</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>To develop home resources, with no foreign cares to fret us,</p>
<p class='c023'>Using house-made faith more frequent; but our parson wouldn’t let us!</p>
<p class='c023'>To view the same old scenery, time and time again he’d call us—</p>
<p class='c023'>Over rivers, plains, and mountains he would any minute haul us;</p>
<p class='c023'>He slighted our soul-sorrows, and our spirits’ aches and ailings,</p>
<p class='c023'>To get the cargo ready for his regular Sunday sailings!</p>
<p class='c023'>Why, he’d take us off a-touring, in all spiritual weather,</p>
<p class='c023'>Till we at last got home-sick and sea-sick all together!</p>
<p class='c023'>And “I wish to all that’s peaceful,” said one free-expressioned brother,</p>
<p class='c023'>“That the Lord had made one cont’nent, an’ then never made another!”</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<p class='c023'>Sometimes, indeed, he’d take us into old, familiar places,</p>
<p class='c023'>And pull along quite nat’ral, in the good old Gospel traces:</p>
<p class='c023'>But soon my wife would shudder, just as if a chill had got her,</p>
<p class='c023'>Whispering, “Oh, my goodness gracious! he’s a-takin’ to the water!”</p>
<p class='c023'>And it wasn’t the same old comfort, when he called around to see us;</p>
<p class='c023'>On some branch of foreign travel he was sure at last to tree us;</p>
<p class='c023'>All unconscious of his error, he would sweetly patronise us,</p>
<p class='c023'>And with oft-repeated stories still endeavours to surprise us.</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<p class='c023'>And the sinners got to laughing; and that finally galled and stung us,</p>
<p class='c023'>To ask him, wouldn’t he kindly once more settle down among us?</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Didn’t he think that more home produce would improve our soul’s digestions?</p>
<p class='c023'>They appointed me committee-man to go and ask the questions.</p>
<p class='c023'>I found him in his garden, trim an’ buoyant as a feather;</p>
<p class='c023'>He shook my hand, exclaiming, “This is quite Italian weather!</p>
<p class='c023'>How it ’minds me of the evenings when, your distant-hearts caressing,</p>
<p class='c023'>Upon my dear good brothers, I invoked God’s choicest blessing!”</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<p class='c023'>I went and told the brothers, “No; I cannot bear to grieve him;</p>
<p class='c023'>He’s so happy in his exile, it’s the proper place to leave him.</p>
<p class='c023'>I took that journey to him, and right bitterly I rue it;</p>
<p class='c023'>But I cannot take it from him; if <i>you</i> want to, go and do it.”</p>
<p class='c023'>Now a new restraint entirely seemed next Sunday to enfold him,</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<p class='c023'>And he looked so hurt and humbled, that I knew that they had told him.</p>
<p class='c023'>Subdued-like was his manner, and some tones were hardly vocal;</p>
<p class='c023'>But every word and sentence was pre-eminently local!</p>
<p class='c023'>Still, the sermon sounded awkward, and we awkward felt who heard it;</p>
<p class='c023'>’Twas a grief to see him steer it—’twas a pain to hear him word it.</p>
<p class='c023'>“When I was abroad”—was maybe half-a-dozen times repeated;</p>
<p class='c023'>But that sentence seemed to choke him, and was always uncompleted.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>As weeks went on, his old smile would occasionally brighten,</p>
<p class='c023'>But the voice was growing feeble, and the face began to whiten;</p>
<p class='c023'>He would look off to the eastward, with a wistful, weary sighing,</p>
<p class='c023'>And ’twas whispered that our pastor in a foreign land was dying.</p>
<hr class='c017' />
<p class='c023'>The coffin lay ’mid garlands, smiling sad as if they knew us;</p>
<p class='c023'>The patient face within it preached a final sermon to us;</p>
<p class='c023'>Our parson <i>had</i> gone touring—on a trip he’d long been earning—</p>
<p class='c023'>In that wonderland, whence tickets are not issued for returning!</p>
<p class='c023'>O tender, good heart-shepherd! your sweet smiling lips, half-parted,</p>
<p class='c023'>Told of scenery that burst on you, just the minute that you started!</p>
<p class='c023'>Could you preach once more among us, you might wander, without fearing;</p>
<p class='c023'>You could give us tales of glory that we’d never tire of hearing!</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>A RAILROAD “RECUSSANT.”</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_1_0_65 c008'>A FRIEND of ours, sojourning during the past summer
in one of the far-off “shore-towns” of Massachusett’s
Bay, was not a little amused one day at the querulous
complainings of “one” of the “oldest inhabitants” against
railroads; his experience in which consisted in having seen
the end of one laid out, and at length the cars running
upon it. Taking out his old pipe, on a pleasant summer
afternoon, and looking off upon the ocean, and the ships
far off and out at sea with the sun upon their sails, he said:
“<i>I</i> don’t think much o’ railroads: they aint no kind o’
<i>justice</i> into ’em. Neöw what kind o’ justice is it, when
railroads takes one man’s upland and carts it over in wheel-barrers
onto another man’s <i>ma’sh</i>? What kind o’ ’commodation
be they? You can’t go when you <i>want</i> to go; you
got to go when the bell rings, or the noisy whistle blows.
I tell yeöw it’s payin’ tew much for the whistle. Ef you
live a leetle ways off the dee-pot, you got to pay to
<i>git</i> to the railroad; and ef you want to go any wheres
else ’cept just to the eend on it, you got to pay to go
a’ter you git <i>there</i>. What kind o’ ’commodation is <i>that</i>?
Goin’ round the country tew, murderin’ folks, runnin’ over
cattle, sheep, and hogs, and settin’ fire to bridges, and
every now and then burnin’ up the woods. Mrs. Robbins,
down to Cod-p’int, says—and she ought to know, for she’s
a pious woman, and belongs to the lower church—she says
to me, no longer ago than day-’fore yesterday, that she’d
be cuss’d if she didn’t <i>know</i> that they sometimes run
over critters <i>a-purpose</i>. They did a likely shoat o’ her’n,
and never paid for’t, ’cause they was a ‘corporation,’
they said. What kind o’ ’commodation is that? Besides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>now I’ve lived here, clus to the dee-pot, ever sence the
road started to run, and seen ’em go out and come
in; but <i>I</i> never could see that they went so d—d <i>fast</i>,
nuther!”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“BETSEY HAIN’T HANDSOME.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I&nbsp;SUPPOSE we are about as happy as the most of folks,
but as I was sayin’ a few days ago to Betsey Bobbet,
a neighbourin’ female of ours—“Every station-house in
life has its various skeletons. But we ort to try to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>contented with that spear of life we are called on to handle.”
Betsey hain’t married, and she don’t seem to be contented.
She is awful opposed to wimmin’s rights—she thinks it is
wimmin’s only spear to marry, but as yet she can’t find any
man willin’ to lay holt of that spear with her. But you can
read in her daily life, and on her eager, willin’ countenance,
that she fully realises the sweet words of the poet, “While
there is life there is hope.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Betsey hain’t handsome. Her cheek-bones are high, and
she bein’ not much more than skin and bone they show
plainer than they would if she was in good order. Her
complexion (not that I blame her for it) hain’t good, and
her eyes are little and sot way back in her head. Time
has seen fit to deprive her of her hair and teeth, but her
large nose he has kindly suffered her to keep, but she has
got the best white ivory teeth money will buy; and two
long curls fastened behind each ear, besides frizzles on the
top of her head; and if she wasn’t naturally bald, and if the
curls was the colour of her hair, they would look well. She
is awful sentimental; I have seen a good many that had
it bad, but of all the sentimental creeters I ever did see,
Betsey Bobbet is the sentimentalest; you couldn’t squeeze
a laugh out of her with a cheeze press.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I said, she is awful opposed to wimmin’s havin’ any
right, only the right to get married. She holds on to that
right as tight as any single woman I ever see, which makes
it hard and wearyin’ on the single men round here.</p>

<p class='c009'>For take the men that are the most opposed to wimmin’s
havin’ a right, and talk the most about its bein’ her duty to
cling to man like a vine to a tree, they don’t want Betsey to
cling to them, they <i>won’t let</i> her cling to ’em. For when
they would be a-goin’ on about how wicked it was for
wimmin to vote—and it was her only spear to marry, says I
to ’em, “Which had you ruther do, let Betsey Bobbet cling
to you or let her vote?” and they would every one of ’em
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>quail before that question. They would drop their heads
before my keen grey eyes—and move off the subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Betsey don’t get discourajed. Every time I see her
she says in a hopeful, wishful tone, “That the deepest men
of minds in the country agree with her in thinkin’ that it is
wimmin’s duty to marry and not to vote.” And then she
talks a sight about the retirin’ modesty and dignity of the
fair sect, and how shameful and revoltin’ it would be to see
wimmin throwin’ ’em away, and boldly and unblushin’ly
talkin’ about law and justice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why, to hear Betsey Bobbet talk about wimmin’s throwin’
their modesty away, you would think if they ever went to
the political pole, they would have to take their dignity and
modesty and throw ’em against the pole, and go without
any all the rest of their lives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now I don’t believe in no such stuff as that. I think a
woman can be bold and unwomanly in other things besides
goin’ with a thick veil over her face, and a brass-mounted
parasol, once a year, and gently and quietly dropping a vote
for a Christian President, or a religious and noble-minded
pathmaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>She thinks she talks dreadful polite and proper. She
says, “I was cameing,” instead of “I was coming;” and “I
have saw,” instead of “I have seen;” and “papah” for
paper, and “deah” for dear. I don’t know much about
grammer, but common sense goes a good ways. She writes
the poetry for the <i>Jonesville Augur</i>, or “<i>Augah</i>,” as she
calls it. She used to write for the opposition paper, the
<i>Jonesville Gimlet</i>, but the editer of the <i>Augur</i>, a long-haired
chap, who moved into Jonesville a few months ago, lost his
wife soon after he come there, and sence that she has turned
Dimocrat, and writes for his paper stiddy. They say that
he is a dreadful big feelin’ man, and I have heard—it came
right straight to me—his cousin’s wife’s sister told it to the
mother-in-law of one of my neighbour’s brother’s wife, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>he didn’t like Betsey’s poetry at all, and all he printed it for
was to plague the editer of the <i>Gimlet</i>, because she used to
write for him. I myself wouldn’t give a cent a bushel for
all the poetry she can write. And it seems to me, that if I
was Betsey, I wouldn’t try to write so much. Howsumever,
I don’t know what turn I should take if I was Betsey
Bobbet; that is a solemn subject, and one I don’t love to
think on.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never shall forget the first piece of her poetry I ever
see. Josiah Allen and I had both on us been married
goin’ on a year, and I had occasion to go to his trunk
one day, where he kept a lot of old papers, and the first
thing I laid my hand on was these verses. Josiah went
with her a few times after his wife died, on 4th of July
or so, and two or three camp meetin’s, and the poetry
seemed to be wrote about the time <i>we</i> was married. It
was directed over the top of it, “Owed to Josiah,” just
as if she were in debt to him. This was the way it read—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Josiah, I the tale have hurn,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With rigid ear, and streaming eye,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I saw from me that you did turn,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I never knew the reason why.</div>

      <div class='line in1'>Seemed crunching on my vitals too.</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>I saw thee washing sheep last night,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>On the bridge I stood with marble brow,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The waters raged, thou clasped it tight,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I sighed, ‘should both be drownded now’—</div>
      <div class='line in6'>I thought, Josiah,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Oh happy sheep to thus expiah.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I showed the poetry to Josiah that night after he came
home, and told him I had read it. He looked awful
ashamed to think I had seen it, and, says he, with a
dreadful sheepish look, “The persecution I underwent
from that female can never be told; she fairly hunted
me down. I hadn’t no rest for the soles of my feet. I
thought one spell she would marry me in spite of all I
could do, without givin’ me the benefit of law or gospel.”
He see I looked stern, and he added, with a sick lookin’
smile, “I thought one spell,” to use Betsey’s language,
“I was a gonah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I didn’t smile. Oh no, for the deep principle of my sect
was reared up. I says to him, in a tone cold enough to
almost freeze his ears, “Josiah Allen, shet up; of all the
cowardly things a man ever done, it is goin’ round braggin’
about wimmin likin’ ’em, and follerin’ ’em up. Enny man
that’ll do that is little enough to crawl through a knot hole
without rubbing his clothes.” Says I, “I suppose you
made her think the moon rose in your head and set in your
heels. I daresay you acted foolish enough round her to
sicken a snipe, and if you makes fun of her now to please me,
I let you know you have got holt of the wrong individual.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“I SHOWED THE POETRY TO JOSIAH THAT NIGHT.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” says I, “go to bed;” and I added, in still more
freezing accents, “for I want to mend your pantaloons.”
We gathered up his shoes and stockin’s and started off to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>bed, and we hain’t never passed a word on the subject sence.
I believe when you disagree with your pardner, in freein’ your
<i>mind</i> in the first on’t, and then not to be a-twittin’ about it
afterwards. And as for bein’ jealous, I should jest as soon
think of bein’ jealous of a meetin’-house as I should of
Josiah. He is a well principled man. And I guess he
wasn’t fur out o’ the way about Betsey Bobbet, though I
wouldn’t encourage him by lettin’ him say a word on the
subject, for I always make it a rule to stand up for my own
sect; but when I hear her go on about the editer of the
<i>Augur</i>, I can believe anything about Betsey Bobbet.</p>

<p class='c009'>She came in here one day last week. It was about ten
o’clock in the mornin’. I had got my house slick as a pin,
and my dinner under way (I was goin’ to have a biled
dinner, and a cherry puddin’ biled, with sweet sass to eat on
it), and I sot down to finish sewin’ up the breadth of my
new rag carpet. I thought I would get it done while I
hadn’t so much to do, for it bein’ the 1st of March I knew
sugarin’ would be comin’ on, and then cleanin’-house time,
and I wanted it to put down jest as soon as the stove was
carried out in the summer kitchin. The fire was sparklin’
away, and the painted floor a-shinin’ and the dinner a-bilin’,
and I sot there sewin’ jest as calm as a clock, not dreamin’
of no trouble, when in came Betsey Bobbet.</p>

<p class='c009'>I met her with outward calm, and asked her set down
and lay off her things. She sot down, but she said she
couldn’t lay off her things. Says she, “I was comin’
down past, and I thought I would call and let you see the
last numbah of the <i>Augah</i>. There is a piece in it concernin’
the tariff that stirs men’s souls. I like it evah so
much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She handed me the paper, folded so I couldn’t see nothin’
but a piece of poetry by Betsey Bobbet. I see what she
wanted of me, and so I dropped my breadths of carpetin’
and took hold of it, and began to read it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“Read it audible, if you please,” says she. “Especially
the precious remahks ovah it; it is such a feast for me to be
a sittin’ and heah it reheahsed by a musical vorce.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Says I, “I spose I can rehearse it if it will do you any
good,” so I began as follows:—</p>

<p class='c024'>“It is seldom that we present to the readers of the <i>Augur</i> (the best
paper for the fireside in Jonesville or the world) with a poem like the
following. It may be, by the assistance of the <i>Augur</i> (only twelve
shillings a year in advance, wood and potatoes taken in exchange), the
name of Betsey Bobbet will yet be carved on the lofty pinnacle of
fame’s towering pillow. We think, however, that she could study such
writers as Sylvanus Cobb, and Tupper, with profit both to herself and
to them.</p>
<div class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Editor of the Augur.</span>”</div>

<p class='c022'>Here Betsey interrupted me. “The deah editah of the
<i>Augah</i> has no need to advise me to read Tuppah, for he is
indeed my most favourite authar. You have devorhed him,
haven’t you, Josiah Allen’s wife?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Devoured who?” says I, in a tone pretty near as cold
as a cold icicle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahten, Fahqueah, Tuppah, that sweet authar,” says
she.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, mom,” says I shortly; “I hain’t devoured Martin
Farquhar Tupper, nor no other man. I hain’t a cannibal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you understand me not; I meant, devorhed his
sweet, tender lines.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hain’t devoured his tenderlines, nor nothin’ relatin’ to
him,” and I made a motion to lay the paper down, but
Betsey urged me to go on, and so I read—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“What think you of it?” says she, as I finished readin’.</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked right at her most a minute with a majestic look.
In spite of her false curls, and her new white ivory teeth,
she is a humbly critter. I looked at her silently while she
sot and twisted her long yellow bunnet-strings, and then I
spoke out. “Hain’t the editer of the <i>Augur</i> a widower
with a pair of twins?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” says she with a happy look.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then says I, “If the man hain’t a fool, he’ll think you
are one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” says she, and she dropped her bunnet-strings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and clasped her long bony hands together in her brown
cotton gloves, “Oh, we ahdent soles of genious have
feelin’s, you cold, practical natures know nuthing of, and if
they did not gush out in poetry we should expiah. You
may as well try to tie up the gushing catarack of Niagara
with a piece of welting cord, as to tie up the feelin’s of an
ahdent sole.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ardent sole!” says I coldly. “Which makes the most
noise, Betsey Bobbet, a three-inch brook, or a ten-footer?
which is the tearer? which is the roarer? deep waters run
stillest. I have no faith in feelin’s that stalk round in
public in mournin’ weeds. I have no faith in such
mourners,” says I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Josiah’s wife, cold, practical female being, you
know me not; we, are sundered as fah apart as if you was
sitting on the North Pole, and I was sitting on the South
Pole. Uncongenial being, you know me not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I may not know you, Betsey Bobbet, but I do know
decency, and I know that no munny would tempt me to
write such stuff as that poetry and send it to a widower with
twins.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” says she, “what appeals to the tendah feelin’
heart of a single female woman more than to see a lonely
man who has lost his relict? And pity never seems so
much like pity as when it is given to the deah little children
of widowehs. And,” says she, “I think moah than as
likely as not, this soaring sole of genious did not wed his
affinity, but was united to a mere woman of clay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mere woman of clay!” says I, fixin’ my spektacles upon
her in a most searchin’ manner. “Where will you find a
woman, Betsey Bobbet, that hain’t more or less clay? And
affinity, that is the meanest word I ever heard; no married
woman has any right to hear it. I’ll excuse you, bein’ a
female; but if a man had said it to me, I’d holler to Josiah.
There is a time for everything, and the time to hunt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>affinity is before you are married; married folks hain’t no
right to hunt it,” says I sternly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We kindred soles soah above such petty feelings, we
soah far above them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hain’t much of a soarer,” says I, “and I don’t pretend
to be; and to tell you the truth,” says I, “I am glad I
hain’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Editah of the <i>Augah</i>,” says she, and she grasped
the paper offen the stand, and folded it up, and presented
it at me like a spear, “the Editah of this paper is a kindred
sole, he appreciates me, he undahstands me, and will not
our names in the pages of this very papah go down to
posterety togathah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then says I, drove out of all patience with her, “I
wish you was there now, both of you. I wish,” says I,
lookin’ fixedly on her, “I wish you was both of you in
posterity now.”</p>

</div>
<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib111.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>IT was in the latter part of August of that year that it
became necessary for some one in the office in which I
was engaged to go to St. Louis to attend to important
business. Everything seemed to point to me as the fit
person, for I understood the particular business better than
any one else. I felt that I ought to go, but I did not
altogether like to do it. I went home, and Euphemia and
I talked over the matter far into the regulation sleeping
hours.</p>
<p class='c009'>There were very good reasons why we should go (for of
course I would not think of taking such a journey without
Euphemia). In the first place it would be of advantage to
me, in my business connection, to take the trip, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>it would be such a charming journey for us. We had never
been west of the Alleghanies, and nearly all the country we
would see would be new to us. We would come home by
the great lakes and Niagara, and the prospect was delightful
to both of us. But then we would have to leave Rudder
Grange for at least three weeks, and how could we do
that?</p>

<p class='c009'>This was indeed a difficult question to answer. Who
could take care of our garden, our poultry, our horse and
cow, and all their complicated belongings? The garden
was in admirable condition. Our vegetables were coming
in every day in just that fresh and satisfactory condition—altogether
unknown to people who buy vegetables—for
which I had laboured so faithfully, and about which I had
had so many cheerful anticipations. As to Euphemia’s
chicken-yard,—with Euphemia away,—the subject was too
great for us. We did not even discuss it. But we would
give up all the pleasures of our home for the chance of this
most desirable excursion, if we could but think of some one
who would come and take care of the place while we were
gone. Rudder Grange could not run itself for three weeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>We thought of every available person. Old John would
not do. We did not feel that we could trust him. We
thought of several of our friends; but there was, in both our
minds, a certain shrinking from the idea of handing over
the place to any of them for such a length of time. For
my part, I said, I would rather leave Pomona in charge than
any one else; but then, Pomona was young and a girl.
Euphemia agreed with me that she would rather trust her
than any one else, but she also agreed in regard to the disqualifications.
So when I went to the office the next
morning, we had fully determined to go on the trip, if we
could find some one to take charge of our place while we
were gone. When I returned from the office in the afternoon
I had agreed to go to St. Louis. By this time I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>no choice in the matter, unless I wished to interfere very
much with my own interests. We were to start in two days.
If in that time we could get any one to stay at the place,
very well; if not, Pomona must assume the charge. We
were not able to get any one, and Pomona did assume the
charge. It is surprising how greatly relieved we felt when
we were obliged to come to this conclusion. The arrangement
was exactly what we wanted, and now that there was
no help for it, our consciences were easy.</p>

<p class='c009'>We felt sure that there would be no danger to Pomona.
Lord Edward would be with her, and she was a young
person who was extraordinarily well able to take care of
herself. Old John would be within call in case she needed
him, and I borrowed a bull-dog to be kept in the house at
night. Pomona herself was more than satisfied with the
plan.</p>

<p class='c009'>We made out, the night before we left, a long and minute
series of directions for her guidance in household, garden,
and farm matters, and directed her to keep a careful record
of everything noteworthy that might occur. She was fully
supplied with all the necessaries of life, and it has seldom
happened that a young girl has been left in such a responsible
and independent position as that in which we left
Pomona. She was very proud of it. Our journey was ten
times more delightful than we had expected it would be,
and successful in every way; and yet although we enjoyed
every hour of the trip, we were no sooner fairly on our way
home than we became so wildly anxious to get there that
we reached Rudder Grange on Wednesday, whereas we had
written that we would be home on Thursday. We arrived
early in the afternoon and walked up from the station,
leaving our baggage to be sent in the express-waggon. As
we approached our dear home we wanted to run, we were
so eager to see it.</p>

<p class='c009'>There it was, the same as ever. I lifted the gate-latch;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the gate was locked. We ran to the carriage-gate; that
was locked too. Just then I noticed a placard on the
fence; it was not printed, but the lettering was large,
apparently made with ink and a brush. It read—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>To Be Sold</span></div>
      <div class='line in5'><span class='sc'>For Taxes</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We stood and looked at each other. Euphemia turned
pale.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does this mean?” said I. “Has our landlord——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I could say no more. The dreadful thought arose that
the place might pass away from us. We were not yet ready
to buy it. But I did not put the thought in words. There
was a field next to our lot, and I got over the fence and
helped Euphemia over. Then we climbed our side-fence.
This was more difficult, but we accomplished it without
thinking much about its difficulties; our hearts were too
full of painful apprehensions. I hurried to the front door;
it was locked. All the lower windows were shut. We went
around to the kitchen. What surprised us more than
anything else was the absence of Lord Edward. Had <i>he</i>
been sold?</p>

<p class='c009'>Before we reached the back part of the house Euphemia
said she felt faint and must sit down. I led her to a tree
near by, under which I had made a rustic chair. The chair
was gone. She sat on the grass, and I ran to the pump for
some water. I looked for the bright tin dipper which
always hung by the pump. It was not there. But I had
a travelling-cup in my pocket, and as I was taking it out I
looked around me. There was an air of bareness over
everything. I did not know what it all meant, but I know
that my hand trembled as I took hold of the pump-handle
and began to pump.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the first sound of the pump-handle I heard a deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>bark in the direction of the barn, and then furiously around
the corner came Lord Edward.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before I had filled the cup he was bounding about me.
I believe the glad welcome of the dog did more to revive
Euphemia than the water. He was delighted to see us,
and in a moment up came Pomona, running from the barn.
Her face was radiant too. We felt relieved. Here were
two friends who looked as if they were neither sold nor
ruined.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pomona quickly saw that we were ill at ease, and before
I could put a question to her she divined the cause. Her
countenance fell.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know,” said she, “you said you wasn’t comin’ till
to-morrow. If you only <i>had</i> come then—I was goin’ to
have everything just exactly right—an’ now you had to
climb in——”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the poor girl looked as if she might cry, which
would have been a wonderful thing for Pomona to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell me one thing,” said I. “What about—those
taxes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, that’s all right,” she cried. “Don’t think another
minute about that. I’ll tell you all about it soon. But
come in first, and I’ll get you some lunch in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We were somewhat relieved by Pomona’s statement that
it was “all right” in regard to the tax-poster, but we were
very anxious to know all about the matter. Pomona,
however, gave us little chance to ask her any questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as she had made ready our lunch she asked us,
as a particular favour, to give her three-quarters of an hour
to herself, and then, said she, “I’ll have everything looking
just as if it was to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We respected her feelings, for, of course, it was a great
disappointment to her to be taken thus unawares, and we
remained in the dining-room until she appeared, and
announced that she was ready for us to go about. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>availed ourselves quickly of the privilege, and Euphemia
hurried to the chicken-yard, while I bent my steps toward
the garden and barn. As I went out I noticed that the
rustic chair was in its place, and passing the pump I looked
for the dipper. It was there. I asked Pomona about the
chair, but she did not answer as quickly as was her habit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you rather,” said she, “hear it altogether, when
you come in, or have it in little bits, head and tail, all of a
jumble?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I called to Euphemia and asked her what she thought, and
she was so anxious to get to her chickens that she said she
would much rather wait and hear it altogether. We found
everything in perfect order,—the garden was even free from
weeds, a thing I had not expected. If it had not been for
that cloud on the front fence, I should have been happy
enough. Pomona had said it was all right, but she could
not have paid the taxes—however, I would wait; and I
went to the barn.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Euphemia came in from the poultry-yard, she
called me and said she was in a hurry to hear Pomona’s
account of things. So I went in, and we sat on the side
porch, where it was shady, while Pomona, producing some
sheets of foolscap paper, took her seat on the upper step.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wrote down the things of any account what happened,”
said she, “as you told me to, and while I was about it, I
thought I’d make it like a novel. It would be jus’ as true,
and p’r’aps more amusin’. I suppose you don’t mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>No, we didn’t mind. So she went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I haven’t got no name for my novel. I intended to
think one out to-night. I wrote this all of nights. And I
don’t read the first chapters, for they tell about my birth
and my parent-age, and my early adventures. I’ll just come
down to what happened to me while you was away, because
you’ll be more anxious to hear about that. All that’s
written here is true, jus’ the same as if I told it to you, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>I’ve put it into novel language because it seems to come
easier to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And then, in a voice somewhat different from her ordinary
tones, as if the “novel language” demanded it, she began to
read—</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Chapter Five. The Lonely house and the Faithful
friend. Thus was I left alone. None but two dogs to
keep me com-pa-ny. I milk-ed the lowing kine and
water-ed and fed the steed, and then, after my fru-gal
repast, I clos-ed the man-si-on, shutting out all re-collections
of the past and also foresights into the future. That
night was a me-mor-able one. I slept soundly until the
break of morn, but had the events transpired which afterward
occur-red, what would have hap-pen-ed to me no
tongue can tell. Early the next day nothing hap-pened.
Soon after breakfast the vener-able John came to bor-row
some ker-o-sene oil and a half a pound of sugar, but his
attempt was foil-ed. I knew too well the in-sid-i-ous foe.
In the very out-set of his vil-li-an-y I sent him home with
a empty can. For two long days I wan-der-ed amid the
ver-dant pathways of the garden and to the barn, whenever
and anon my du-ty call-ed me, nor did I ere neg-lect the
fowlery. No cloud o’er-spread this happy peri-od of my
life. But the cloud was ri-sing in the horizon, although I
saw it not.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘It was about twenty-five minutes after eleven, on the
morning of a Thursday, that I sat pondering in my mind
the ques-ti-on what to do with the butter and the veg-et-ables.
Here was butter, and here was green corn and limabeans
and trophy tomats, far more than I ere could use.
And here was a horse, idly cropping the fol-i-age in the
field, for as my employer had advis-ed and order-ed, I had
put the steed to grass. And here was a waggon, none too
new, which had it the top taken off, or even the curtains
roll-ed up, would do for a li-cen-sed vendor. With the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>truck and butter, and mayhap some milk, I could load the
waggon——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Pomona,” interrupted Euphemia, “you don’t mean
to say that you were thinking of doing anything like that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I was just beginning to think of it,” said Pomona.
“But, of course, I couldn’t have gone away and left the
house. And you’ll see I didn’t do it.” And then she continued
her novel. “‘But while my thoughts were thus
employ-ed, I heard Lord Edward burst into bark-ter——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this Euphemia and I could not help bursting into
laughter. Pomona did not seem at all confused, but went
on with her reading.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I hurried to the door, and, look-ing out, I saw a
waggon at the gate. Re-pair-ing there, I saw a man. Said
he, “Wilt open the gate?” I had fasten-ed up the gates
and remov-ed every stealable ar-ticle from the yard.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Euphemia and I looked at each other. This explained
the absence of the rustic seat and the dipper.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Thus, with my mind at ease, I could let my faith-ful
fri-end, the dog, for he it was, roam with me through the
grounds, while the fi-erce bull-dog guard-ed the man-si-on
within. Then said I, quite bold unto him, “No. I let in
no man here. My em-ploy-er and employ-er-ess are now
from home. What do you want?” Then says he, as bold
as brass, “I’ve come to put the light-en-ing rods upon the
house. Open the gate.” “What rods?” says I. “The rods
as was order-ed,” says he. “Open the gate.” I stood and
gaz-ed at him. Full well I saw through his pinch-beck
mask. I knew his tricks. In the ab-sence of my em-ployer,
he would put up rods, and ever so many more than was
wanted, and likely, too, some miser-able trash that would
attract the light-en-ing, instead of keep-ing it off. Then, as
it would spoil the house to take them down, they would be
kept, and pay demand-ed. “No, sir,” says I. “No light-en-ing
rods upon this house whilst I stand here,” and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>that I walk-ed away, and let Lord Edward loose. The man
he storm-ed with pas-si-on. His eyes flash-ed fire. He
would e’en have scal-ed the gate, but when he saw the dog
he did forbear. As it was then near noon, I strode away to
feed the fowls; but when I did return, I saw a sight which
froze the blood with-in my veins——’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dog didn’t kill him?” cried Euphemia.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, ma’am!” said Pomona. “You’ll see that that
wasn’t it. At one cor-ner of the lot, in front, a base boy,
who had accompa-ni-ed this man was bang-ing on the fence
with a long stick, and thus attrack-ing to hisself the rage of
Lord Edward, while the vile intrig-er of a light-en-ing rodder
had brought a lad-der to the other side of the house,
up which he had now as-cend-ed, and was on the roof.
What horrors fill-ed my soul! How my form trembl-ed!
This,” continued Pomona, “is the end of the novel,” and
she laid her foolscap pages on the porch.</p>

<p class='c009'>Euphemia and I exclaimed, with one voice, against this.
We had just reached the most exciting part, and, I added,
we had heard nothing yet about that affair of the taxes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see, sir,” said Pomona, “it took me so long to
write out the chapters about my birth, my parentage, and
my early adventures, that I hadn’t time to finish up the
rest. But I can tell you what happened after that jus’ as
well as if I had writ it out.” And so she went on, much
more glibly than before, with the account of the doings
of the lightning-rod man.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id019'>
<img src='images/ib121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“AND HE COMES DOWN AS LOW AS HE COULD.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“There was that wretch on top of the house, a-fixin’ his
old rods and hammerin’ away for dear life. He’d brought
his ladder over the side fence, where the dog, a-barkin’
and plungin’ at the boy outside, couldn’t see him. I stood
dumb for a minute, and then I know’d I had him. I
rushed into the house, got a piece of well-rope, tied it
to the bull-dog’s collar, an’ dragged him out and fastened
him to the bottom rung of the ladder. Then I walks over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to the front fence with Lord Edward’s chain, for I knew
that if he got at that bull-dog there’d be times, for they’d
never been allowed to see each other yet. So says I to
the boy, ‘I’m goin’ to tie up the dog, so you needn’t be
afraid of his jumpin’ over the fence,’—which he couldn’t
do, or the boy would have been a corpse for twenty
minutes, or maybe half-an-hour. The boy kinder laughed,
and said I needn’t mind, which I didn’t. Then I went to
the gate and I clicked to the horse which was standin’
there, an’ off he starts, as good as gold, an’ trots down
the road. The boy, he said somethin’ or other pretty bad
an’ away he goes after him; but the horse was a-trottin’
real fast, an’ had a good start.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How on earth could you ever think of doing such
things?” said Euphemia. “That horse might have upset
the waggon and broken all the lightning-rods, besides running
over I don’t know how many people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you see, ma’am, that wasn’t my look-out,” said
Pomona. “I was a-defendin’ the house, and the enemy
must expect to have things happen to him. So then I
hears an awful row on the roof, and there was the man
just coming down the ladder. He’d heard the horse go
off, and when he got about half-way down an’ caught
a sight of the bull-dog, he was madder than ever you seed
a lightnin’-rodder in all your born days. ‘Take that dog
off of there!’ he yelled at me. ‘No, I won’t,’ says I.
‘I never see a girl like you since I was born,’ he
screams at me. ‘I guess it would ’a’ been better fur
you if you had,’ says I; an’ then he was so mad he
couldn’t stand it any longer, and he comes down as low
as he could, and when he saw just how long the rope
was—which was pretty short—he made a jump, and landed
clear of the dog. Then he went on dreadful because he
couldn’t get at his ladder to take it away; and I wouldn’t
untie the dog, because if I had he’d ’a’ torn the tendons out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of that fellow’s legs in no time. I never see a dog in such
a boiling passion, and yet never making no sound at all but
blood-curdlin’ grunts. An’ I don’t see how the rodder
would ’a’ got his ladder at all if the dog hadn’t made an
awful jump at him, and jerked the ladder down. It just
missed your geranium-bed, and the rodder, he ran to the
other end of it, and began pulling it away, dog and all.
‘Look-a-here,’ says I, ‘we can fix him now;’ and so he
cooled down enough to help me, and I unlocked the front
door, and we pushed the bottom end of the ladder in, dog
and all; an’ then I shut the door as tight as it would go
an’ untied the end of the rope, an’ the rodder pulled the
ladder out while I held the door to keep the dog from
follerin’, which he came pretty near doin’, anyway. But I
locked him in, and then the man began stormin’ again
about his waggon; but when he looked out an’ see the boy
comin’ back with it—for somebody must ’a’ stopped the
horse—he stopped stormin’ and went to put up his ladder
ag’in. ‘No, you don’t,’ says I; ‘I’ll let the big dog loose
next time, and if I put him at the foot of your ladder, you’ll
never come down.’ ‘But I want to go and take down
what I put up,’ he says; ‘I ain’t a-goin’ on with this job.’
‘No,’ says I, ‘you ain’t; and you can’t go up there to
wrench off them rods and make rain-holes in the roof,
neither.’ He couldn’t get no madder than he was then,
an’ fur a minute or two he couldn’t speak, an’ then he says,
‘I’ll have satisfaction for this.’ An’ says I, ‘How?’ An’
says he, ‘You’ll see what it is to interfere with a ordered
job.’ An’ says I, ‘There wasn’t no order about it;’ an’
says he, ‘I’ll show you better than that;’ an’ he goes to
his waggon an’ gits a book, ‘There,’ says he, ‘read that.’
‘What of it?’ says I; ‘there’s nobody of the name of
Ball lives here.’ That took the man kinder back, and he
said he was told it was the only house on the lane, which I
said was right, only it was the next lane he oughter ’a’ gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>to. He said no more after that, but just put his ladder in
his waggon and went off. But I was not altogether rid of
him. He left a trail of his baleful presence behind him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That horrid bull-dog wouldn’t let me come into the
house! No matter what door I tried, there he was, just
foamin’ mad. I let him stay till nearly night, and then
went and spoke kind to him; but it was no good. He’d
got an awful spite ag’in me. I found something to eat
down cellar, an’ I made a fire outside an’ roasted some
corn and potatoes. That night I slep’ in the barn. I
wasn’t afraid to be away from the house, for I knew it was
safe enough, with that dog in it, and Lord Edward outside.
For three days, Sunday an’ all, I was kep’ out of this here
house. I got along pretty well with the sleepin’ and the
eatin’, but the drinkin’ was the worst. I couldn’t get no
coffee or tea; but there was plenty of milk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why didn’t you get some man to come and attend
to the dog?” I asked. “It was dreadful to live in that
way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I didn’t know no man that could do it,” said
Pomona. “The dog would ’a’ been too much for old
John, and besides, he was mad about the kerosene. Sunday
afternoon, Captain Atkinson and Mrs. Atkinson and
their little girl in a push-waggon, come here, and I told ’em
you was gone away; but they says they would stop a
minute, and could I give them a drink; an’ I had nothin’
to give it them but an old chicken-bowl that I had washed
out, for even the dipper was in the house, an’ I told ’em
everything was locked up, which was true enough, though
they must ’a’ thought you was a queer kind of people; but
I wasn’t a-goin’ to say nothin’ about the dog, fur, to tell the
truth, I was ashamed to do it. So as soon as they’d gone,
I went down into the cellar,—and it’s lucky that I had the
key for the outside cellar door,—and I got a piece of fat
corn-beef and the meat axe. I unlocked the kitchen door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and went in, with the axe in one hand and the meat in the
other. The dog might take his choice. I know’d he must
be pretty nigh famished, for there was nothin’ that he
could get at to eat. As soon as I went in, he came runnin’
to me; but I could see he was shaky on his legs. He
looked a sort of wicked at me, and then he grabbed the
meat. He was all right then.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my!” said Euphemia, “I am so glad to hear that.
I was afraid you never got in. But we saw the dog—is he
as savage yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no!” said Pomona; “nothin’ like it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look here, Pomona,” said I, “I want to know about
those taxes. When do they come into your story?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pretty soon, sir,” said she, and she went on—</p>

<p class='c009'>“After that, I know’d it wouldn’t do to have them two
dogs so that they’d have to be tied up if they see each
other. Just as like as not I’d want them both at once,
and then they’d go to fightin’, and leave me to settle with
some blood-thirsty lightnin’-rodder. So, as I know’d if
they once had a fair fight and found out which was master,
they’d be good friends afterwards, I thought the best thing
to do would be to let ’em fight it out, when there was
nothin’ else for ’em to do. So I fixed up things for the
combat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Pomona!” cried Euphemia, “I didn’t think you
were capable of such a cruel thing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks that way, ma’am, but really it ain’t,” replied the
girl. “It seemed to me as if it would be a mercy to both of
’em to have the thing settled. So I cleared away a place in
front of the wood-shed and unchained Lord Edward, and
then I opened the kitchen door and called the bull. Out
he came, with his teeth a-showin’, and his blood-shot
eyes, and his crooked front legs. Like lightnin’ from the
mount’in blast, he made one bounce for the big dog, and
oh! what a fight there was! They rolled, they gnashed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>they knocked over the wood-horse and sent chips a-flyin’
all ways at wonst. I thought Lord Edward would whip in
a minute or two; but he didn’t, for the bull stuck to him
like a burr, and they was havin’ it, ground and lofty, when
I hears some one run up behind me, and turnin’ quick,
there was the ’piscopalian minister. ‘My! my! my!’ he
hollers, ‘what an awful spectacle! Ain’t there no way of
stoppin’ it?’ ‘No, sir,’ says I, and I told him how I didn’t
want to stop it and the reason why. ‘Then,’ says he,
‘where’s your master?’ and I told him how you was away.
‘Isn’t there any man at all about?’ says he. ‘No,’ says I.
‘Then,’ says he, ‘if there’s nobody else to stop it, I must
do it myself.’ An’ he took off his coat. ‘No,’ says I, ‘you
keep back, sir. If there’s anybody to plunge into that
erena, the blood be mine;’ an’ I put my hand, without
thinkin’, ag’in his black shirt-bosom, to hold him back; but
he didn’t notice, bein’ so excited. ‘Now,’ says I, ‘jist wait
one minute, and you’ll see that bull’s tail go between his
legs. He’s weakenin’.’ An’ sure enough, Lord Edward got
a good grab at him, and was a-shakin’ the very life out of
him, when I run up and took Lord Edward by the collar.
‘Drop it!’ says I; an’ he dropped it, for he know’d he’d
whipped, and he was pretty tired hisself. Then the bull-dog,
he trotted off with his tail a-hangin’ down. ‘Now
then,’ says I, ‘them dogs will be bosom friends for ever
after this.’ ‘Ah me!’ says he, ‘I’m sorry indeed that your
employer, for who I’ve always had a great respect, should
allow you to get into such bad habits.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“That made me feel real bad, and I told him, mighty
quick, that you was the last man in the world to let me do
anything like that, and that if you’d ’a’ been here, you’d ’a’
separated them dogs, if they’d a-chawed your arms off; that
you was very particular about such things, and that it would
be a pity if he was to think you was a dog-fightin’ gentleman,
when I’d often heard you say that, now you was fixed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>settled, the one thing you would like most would be to be
made a vestryman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I sat up straight in my chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pomona!” I exclaimed. “You didn’t tell him that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s what I said, sir, for I wanted him to know what
you really was; an’ he says, ‘Well, well, I never knew that.
It might be a very good thing. I’ll speak to some of the
members about it. There’s two vacancies now in our
vestry.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was crushed; but Euphemia tried to put the matter
into the brightest light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it may all turn out for the best,” she said, “and
you may be elected, and that would be splendid. But it
would be an awfully funny thing for a dog-fight to make you
a vestryman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I could not talk on this subject. “Go on, Pomona,” I
said, trying to feel resigned to my shame, “and tell us about
that poster on the fence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll be to that almost right away,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was two or three days after the dog-fight that I was
down at the barn, and happenin’ to look over to old John’s,
I saw that tree-man there. He was a-showin’ his book to
John, and him and his wife and all the young ones was
a-standin’ there, drinkin’ down them big peaches and pears
as if they was all real. I know’d he’d come here ag’in, for
them fellers never gives you up; and I didn’t know how to
keep him away, for I didn’t want to let the dogs loose on a
man what, after all, didn’t want to do no more harm than
to talk the life out of you. So I just happened to notice,
as I came to the house, how kind of desolate everything
looked, and I thought perhaps I might make it look worse,
and he wouldn’t care to deal here. So I thought of putting
up a poster like that, for nobody whose place was a-goin’ to
be sold for taxes would be likely to want trees. So I run in
the house, and wrote it quick and put it up. And sure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>enough, the man he come along soon, and when he looked
at that paper and tried the gate, an’ looked over the fence
an’ saw the house all shut up an’ not a livin’ soul about,—for
I had both the dogs in the house with me,—he shook his
head an’ walked off, as much as to say, ‘If that man had
fixed his place up proper with my trees, he wouldn’t ’a’
come to this!’ An’ then, as I found the poster worked so
good, I thought it might keep other people from comin’
a-botherin’ around, and so I left it up; but I was a-goin’ to
be sure and take it down before you came.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As it was now pretty late in the afternoon, I proposed
that Pomona should postpone the rest of her narrative until
evening. She said that there was nothing else to tell that
was very particular; and I did not feel as if I could stand
anything more just now, even if it was very particular.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we were alone, I said to Euphemia—</p>

<p class='c009'>“If we ever have to go away from this place again——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we won’t go away,” she interrupted, looking up to
me with as bright a face as she ever had; “at least not for a
long, long, long time to come. And I’m <i>so</i> glad you’re to
be a vestryman.”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“MINUS A HOOP.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>IT was all about a wash-tub. Mrs. Villiers had loaned
Mrs. Ransom her wash-tub. This was two weeks ago
last Monday. When Mrs. Villiers saw it again, which was
the next morning, it stood on her backstoop, minus a hoop.
Mrs. Villiers sent over to Mrs. Ransom’s a request for the
hoop, couched in language calculated to impugn Mrs.
Ransom’s reputation for carefulness. Mrs. Ransom lost
no time in sending back word that the tub was all right
when it was sent back; and delicately intimated that Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Villiers had better sweep before her own door first, whatever
that might mean. Each having discharged a Christian duty
to each other, further communication was immediately cut
off; and the affair was briskly discussed by the neighbours,
who entered into the merits and demerits of the affair with
unselfish zeal. Heaven bless them! Mrs. Ransom clearly
explained her connection with the tub by charging Mr.
Villiers with coming home drunk as a fiddler the night
before Christmas. This bold statement threatened to carry
the neighbours over in a body to Mrs. Ransom’s view, until
Mrs. Villiers remembered, and promptly chronicled the fact,
that the Ransoms were obliged to move away from their
last place because of non-payment of rent. Here the
matter rested among the neighbours, leaving them as undecided
as before. But between the two families immediately
concerned the fire burned as luridly as when first
kindled. It was a constant skirmish between the two
women, from early morning until late at night. Mrs.
Ransom would glare through her blinds when Mrs.
Villiers was in the yard, and murmur between her clenched
teeth—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you hussy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And, with that wonderful instinct which characterises the
human above the brute animal, Mrs. Villiers understood
that Mrs. Ransom was thus engaged, and, lifting her nose
at the highest angle compatible with the safety of her spinal
cord, would sail around the yard as triumphantly as if
escorted by a brigade of genuine princes.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then would come Mrs. Villiers’s turn at the window
with Mrs. Ransom in the yard, with a like satisfactory and
edifying result.</p>

<p class='c009'>When company called on Mrs. Villiers, Mrs. Ransom
would peer from behind her curtains and audibly exclaim—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s that fright, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>And when Mrs. Ransom was favoured with a call, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Mrs. Villiers’s blessed privilege to be at the window and
audibly observe—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where was that clod dug up from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ransom has a little boy named Tommy, and Mrs.
Villiers has a similar sized son, who struggles under the
cognomen of Wickliffe Morgan; and it will happen, because
these two children are too young to grasp fully the grave
responsibilities of life—it will happen, I repeat, that they will
come together in various respects. If Mrs. Ransom is so fortunate
as to first observe one of these cohesions, she promptly
steps to the door, and, covertly waiting until Mrs. Villiers’s
door opens, she shrilly observes—“Thomas Jefferson, come
right into this house this minute! How many times have
I told you to keep away from that Villiers brat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Villiers brat!</i>” What a stab that is! What subtle poison
it is saturated with! Poor Mrs. Villiers’s breath comes thick
and hard; her face burns like fire, and her eyes almost snap
out of her head. She has to press her hand to her heart
as if to keep that organ from bursting; there is no relief
from the dreadful throbbing and the dreadful pain. The
slamming of Mrs. Ransom’s door shuts out all hope of
succour. But it quickens Mrs. Villiers’s faculties, and
makes her so alert, that when the two children come together
again, which they very soon do, she is first at the
door. Now is the opportunity to heap burning coals on
the head of Mrs. Ransom. She heaps them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wickliffe Morgan! what are you doing out there with
that Ransom imp? Do you want to catch some disease?
Come in here before I skin you.” And the door slams
shut, and poor Mrs. Ransom, with trembling form and
bated breath and flashing eyes, clinches her fingers, and
glares with tremendous wrath over the landscape.</p>

<p class='c009'>And in the absence of any real, tangible information as
to the loss of that hoop, this is perhaps the very best that
can be done on either side.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“IT WAS A RAINY SUNDAY.”<br />“I’ll cross it, though it blast me!”—<i>Hamlet.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c025'>IT was a rainy Sunday, in the gloomy month of
November. I had been detained in the course of a
journey by a slight indisposition, from which I was
recovering, but I was still feverish, and was obliged to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>keep within doors all day, in an inn of the small town of
Derby. A wet Sunday in a country inn! whoever has
had the luck to experience one can alone judge of my
situation. The rain pattered against the casements; the
bells tolled for church with a melancholy sound. I went to
the window in quest of something to amuse the eye; but it
seemed as if I had been placed completely out of reach of
all amusement. The windows of my bedroom looked out
among tiled roofs and stacks of chimneys; while those of
my sitting-room commanded a full view of the stable-yard.
I know of nothing more calculated to make a man sick of
this world than a stable-yard on a rainy day. The place
was littered with wet straw that had been kicked about by
travellers and stable-boys; in one corner was a stagnant pool
of water surrounding an island of muck; there were several
half-drowned fowls crowded together under a cart, among
which was a miserable, crestfallen cock, drenched out of all
life and spirit; his drooping tail matted as it were into a
single feather, along which the water trickled from his back.
Near the cart was a half-dozing cow, chewing the cud, and
standing patiently to be rained on, with wreaths of vapour
rising from her reeking hide; a wall-eyed horse, tired of the
loneliness of the stable, was poking his spectral head out of
a window, with the rain dripping on it from the eaves; an
unhappy cur, chained to a dog-house hard by uttering
something every now and then between a bark and a yelp;
a drab of a kitchen wench tramped backwards and forwards
through the yard in pattens, looking as sulky as the weather
itself; everything, in short, was comfortless and forlorn,
excepting a crew of hard-drinking ducks, assembled like
boon companions round a puddle, and making a riotous
noise over their liquor.</p>
<p class='c009'>I was lonely and listless, and wanted amusement. My
room soon became insupportable. I abandoned it and
sought what is technically called the traveller’s room. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>is a public room set apart at most inns for the accommodation
of a class of wayfarers called travellers or riders; a
kind of commercial knights-errant who are incessantly
scouring the kingdom in gigs, on horseback, or by coach.
They are the only successors, that I know of at the present
day, to the knights-errant of yore. They lead the same
kind of roving, adventurous life, only changing the lance
for a whip, the buckler for a pattern-card, and the coat of
mail for an upper Benjamin. Instead of vindicating the
charms of peerless beauty, they rove about spreading the
fame and standing of some substantial tradesman or manufacturer,
and are ready at any time to bargain in his name;
it being the fashion nowadays to trade instead of fight with
one another. As the room of the Hostel, in the good old
fighting times, would be hung round at night with the
armour of wayworn warriors, such as coats of mail,
falchions, and yawning helmets; so the traveller’s room
is garnished with the harnessing of their successors; with
box-coats, whips of all kinds, spurs, gaiters, and oilcloth-covered
hats.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was in hopes of finding some of these worthies to talk
with, but was disappointed, there were, indeed, two or three
in the room, but I could make nothing of them. One was
just finishing his breakfast, quarrelling with his bread and
butter, and huffing the waiter; another buttoned on a pair
of gaiters, with many execrations at “Boots” for not having
cleaned his shoes well; a third sat drumming on the table
with his fingers, and looking at the rain as it streamed
down the window-glass; they all appeared infected by the
weather, and disappeared, one after the other, without
exchanging a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sauntered to the window, and stood gazing at the
people picking their way to church, with petticoats hoisted
mid-leg high, and dripping umbrellas. The bell ceased to
toll, and the streets became silent. I then amused myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>with watching the daughters of a tradesman opposite; who,
being confined to the house, for fear of wetting their
Sunday finery, played off their charms at the front windows
to fascinate the chance tenants of the inn. They at length
were summoned away by a vigilant vinegar-faced mother,
and I had nothing further from without to amuse me.</p>

<p class='c009'>What was I to do to pass away the long-lived day? I
was sadly nervous and lonely; and everything about an inn
seemed calculated to make a dull day ten times duller.
Old newspapers smelling of beer and tobacco smoke, and
which I had already read half-a-dozen times. Good-for-nothing
books, that were worse than the rainy weather.
I bored myself to death with an old volume of the <i>Lady’s
Magazine</i>. I read all the commonplace names of ambitious
travellers scrawled on the panes of glass; the eternal
families of the Smiths, and the Browns, and the Jacksons,
and the Johnsons, and all the other sons; and I deciphered
several scraps of fatiguing inn-window poetry that I have
met with in all parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day continued lowering and gloomy; the slovenly,
ragged, spongy clouds drifted heavily along in the air;
there was no variety even in the rain; it was one dull,
continued, monotonous patter, patter, patter; excepting that
now and then I was enlivened by the idea of a brisk
shower, from the rattlings of the drops upon a passing
umbrella. It was quite <i>refreshing</i> (if I may be allowed a
hackneyed phrase of the day) when in the course of the
morning a horn blew, and a stage-coach whirled through the
street, with outside passengers stuck all over it, cowering
under cotton umbrellas; and seethed together, and reeking
with the steams of wet box-coats and upper Benjamins.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sound brought out from their lurking-places a crew
of vagabond boys and vagabond dogs, with the carroty-headed
hostler and the nondescript animal ycleped Boots,
and all the other vagabond race that infest the purlieus of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>an inn; but the bustle was transient; the coach again
whirled on its way; the boy, and dog, and hostler, and
Boots, all slunk back again to their holes; and the street
again became silent, and the rain continued to rain on.
In fact there was no hope of its clearing up; the barometer
pointed to rainy weather; mine hostess’s tortoise-shell cat
sat by the fire washing her face and rubbing her paws over
her ears; and on referring to the almanac, I found a direful
prediction from the top of the page to the bottom
through the whole month, “expect—much—rain—about—this—time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was dreadfully hipped. The hours seemed as if they
would never creep by. The very ticking of the clock
became irksome. At length the stillness of the house was
interrupted by the ringing of a bell. Shortly after I heard
the voice of a waiter at the bar, “The Stout Gentleman in
No. 13 wants his breakfast. Tea and bread and butter,
with ham and eggs; the eggs not to be too much done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In such a situation as mine every incident is of importance.
Here was a subject of speculation presented to my
mind, and ample exercise for my imagination. I am prone
to paint pictures to myself, and on this occasion I had
some material to work upon. Had the guest upstairs been
mentioned as Mr. Smith, or Mr. Brown, or Jackson, or Mr.
Johnson, or merely as the gentleman in No. 13, it would
have been a perfect blank to me. I should have thought
nothing of it. But “the Stout Gentleman!”—the very
name had something in it of the picturesque. It at once gave
the size, it embodied the personage to my mind’s eye, and
my fancy did the rest. “He was stout, or, as some term it,
lusty; in all probability therefore he was advanced in life;
some people expanding as they grow old. By his breakfasting
rather late, and in his own room, he must be a man
accustomed to live at his ease, and above the necessity of
early rising; no doubt a round, rosy, lusty old gentleman.”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“THE STOUT GENTLEMAN HAD BEEN RUDE TO HER.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There was another violent ringing; the Stout Gentleman
was impatient for his breakfast. He was evidently a man of
importance, “well-to-do in the world,” accustomed to be
promptly waited upon, of a keen appetite, and a little cross
when hungry. “Perhaps,” thought I, “he may be some
London alderman; or who knows but he may be a member
of Parliament?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The breakfast was sent up, and there was a short interval
of silence; he was doubtless making the tea. Presently
there was a violent ringing, and before it could be answered,
another ringing, still more violent. “Bless me! what a
choleric old gentleman!” The waiter came down in a huff.
The butter was rancid, the eggs were overdone, the ham
was too salt. The Stout Gentleman was evidently nice in his
eating. One of those who eat and growl and keep the
waiter on the trot, and live in a state militant with the
household.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hostess got into a fume. I should observe that she
was a brisk, coquettish woman; a little of a shrew, and
something of a slammerkin, but very pretty withal; with a
nincompoop for a husband, as shrews are apt to have. She
rated the servants roundly for their negligence in sending up
so bad a breakfast; but said not a word against the Stout
Gentleman; by which I clearly perceived he must be a man
of consequence; entitled to make a noise and to give
trouble at a country inn. Other eggs and ham and bread
and butter were sent. They appeared to be more graciously
received; at last there was no further complaint, and I had
not made many turns about the traveller’s room when there
was another ringing. Shortly afterwards there was a stir,
and an inquest about the house. “The Stout Gentleman
wanted the <i>Times</i> or the <i>Chronicle</i> newspaper.” I set
him down, therefore, for a whig; or rather, from his being
so absolute and lordly where he had a chance, I suspected
him of being a radical. Hunt, I had heard, was a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>man. “Who knows,” thought I, “but it is Hunt
himself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>My curiosity began to be awakened. I inquired of the
waiter who was this Stout Gentleman that was making all
this stir, but I could get no information. Nobody seemed
to know his name. The landlords of bustling inns seldom
trouble their heads about the names of their transient
guests. The colour of a coat, the shape or size of the
person, is enough to suggest a travelling name. It is either
the tall gentleman, or the short gentleman; or the gentleman
in black, or the gentleman in snuff colour; or, as in
the present instance, the Stout Gentleman; a designation of
the kind once hit on answers every purpose, and saves all
further inquiry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rain—rain—rain! pitiless, ceaseless rain! no such thing
as putting a foot out of doors, and no occupation or
amusement within. By-and-by I heard some one walking
overhead. It was in the Stout Gentleman’s room. He
evidently was a large man by the heaviness of his tread;
and an old man from his wearing such creaking soles.
“He is doubtless,” thought I, “some rich old square-toes, of
regular habits, and is now taking exercise after breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I now read all the advertisements of coaches and hotels
that were stuck about the mantelpiece. The <i>Lady’s
Magazine</i> had become an abomination to me; it was as
tedious as the day itself. I wandered out, not knowing
what to do, and ascended again to my room. I had not
been there long when there was a squall from a neighbouring
bedroom. A door opened and slammed violently; a
chambermaid that I had remarked for a ruddy, good-humoured
face, went downstairs in a violent flurry. The
Stout Gentleman had been rude to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>This sent a whole host of my deductions to the deuce in
a moment. This unknown personage could not be an old
gentleman; for old gentlemen are not apt to be so obstreperous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to chambermaids. He could not be a young gentleman;
for young gentlemen are not apt to inspire such indignation.
He must be a middle-aged man, and confoundedly ugly
into the bargain, or the girl would not have taken the
matter in such terrible dudgeon. I confess I was sorely
puzzled. In a few minutes I heard the voice of my landlady.
I caught a glance of her as she came tramping
upstairs, her face glowing, her cap flaring, her tongue
wagging the whole way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’d have no such doings in her house, she’d warrant.
If gentlemen did spend their money freely, it was no rule.
She’d have no servant-maids of hers treated in that way,
when they were about their work, that’s what she wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As I hate squabbles, particularly with women, and above
all with pretty women, I slunk back into my room, and
partly closed the door; but my curiosity was too much
excited not to listen. The landlady marched intrepidly to
the enemy’s citadel and entered it with a storm. The door
closed after her. I heard her voice in high windy clamour
for a moment or two. Then it gradually subsided, like a
gust of wind in a garret. Then there was a laugh; then I
heard nothing more. After a little while my landlady came
out with an odd smile on her face, adjusting her cap, which
was a little on one side. As she went downstairs I heard
the landlord ask her what was the matter; she said,
“Nothing at all—only the girl’s a fool!” I was more than
ever perplexed what to make of this unaccountable
personage, who could put a good-natured chambermaid in
a passion, and send away a termagant landlady in smiles.
He could not be so old, nor cross, nor ugly either.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had to go to work at his picture again, and to paint
him entirely different. I now set him down for one of
those Stout Gentlemen that are frequently met with swaggering
about the doors of country inns. Moist, merry fellows,
in Belcher handkerchiefs, whose bulk is a little assisted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>malt liquors. Men who have seen the world, and been
sworn at Highgate. Who are used to tavern life; up to
all the tricks of tapsters, and knowing in the ways of sinful
publicans. Free livers on a small scale, who call all the
waiters by name, tousle the maids, gossip with the landlady
at the bar, and prose over a pint of port or a glass of negus
after dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>The morning wore away in forming these and similar
surmises. As fast as I wove one system of belief, some
movement of the unknown would completely overturn it,
and throw all my thoughts again into confusion. Such are
the solitary operations of a feverish mind. I was, as I have
said, extremely nervous, and the continual meditation on
the concerns of this invisible personage began to have its
effects—I was getting a fit of fidgets.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dinner-time came. I hoped the Stout Gentleman might
dine in the traveller’s room, and that I might at length get
a view of his person; but no—he had dinner served in his
own room. What could be the meaning of this solitude
and mystery? He could not be a radical; there was something
too aristocratical in thus keeping himself apart from the
rest of the world, and condemning himself to his own dull
company throughout a rainy day. And then too he lived
too well for a discontented politician. He seemed to
expatiate on a variety of dishes, and to sit over his wine like
a jolly friend of good living.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, my doubts on this head were soon at an end, for
he could not have finished his first bottle before I could
faintly hear him humming a tune, and on listening I found
it to be “God Save the King.” ’Twas plain then he was
no radical, but a faithful subject; one that grew loyal over
his bottle, and was ready to stand by his king and constitution
when he could stand by nothing else. But who could he
be? My conjectures began to run wild. Was he not some
personage of distinction travelling <i>incog.</i>? “God knows!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>said I, at my wit’s end; “it maybe one of the royal family
for aught I know, for they are all Stout Gentlemen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The weather continued rainy. The mysterious person
kept his room, and, as far as I could judge, his chair; for
I did not hear him move. In the meantime, as the day
advanced, the traveller’s room began to be frequented.
Some who had just arrived came in buttoned up in box
coats; others came home who had been dispersed about
the town. Some took their dinners, and some their tea.
Had I been in a different mood, I should have found entertainment
in studying this peculiar class of men. There
were two, especially, who were regular wags of the road,
and up to all the standing jokes of travellers. They had a
thousand sly things to say to the waiting-maid, whom they
called Louisa, and Ethelinda, and a dozen other fine names,
changing the name every time, and chuckling amazingly at
their own waggery. My mind, however, had become completely
engrossed by the Stout Gentleman. He had kept
my fancy in chase during a long day, and it was not now
to be diverted from the scent.</p>

<p class='c009'>The evening gradually wore away. The travellers read
the papers two or three times over. Some drew around the
fire, and told long stories about their horses, about their
adventures, their over-turns, and breakings-down. They
discussed the credits of different merchants and different
inns, and the two wags told several choice anecdotes of
pretty chambermaids and kind landladies. All this passed
as they were quietly taking what they called their “nightcaps,”—that
is to say, strong glasses of brandy and water
with sugar, or some other mixture of the kind; after which
they one after another rang for “boots” and the chambermaids,
and walked up to bed in old shoes, cut down into
marvellously uncomfortable slippers.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was only one man left; a short-legged, long-bodied,
plethoric fellow, with a very large sandy head. He sat by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>himself, with a glass of port wine negus and a spoon,
sipping and stirring until nothing was left but the spoon.
He gradually fell asleep, bolt upright in his chair, with the
empty glass standing before him; and the candle seemed
to fall asleep too, for the wick grew long and black and
cabbaged at the end, and dimmed the little light that
remained in the chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gloom that now prevailed was contagious. Around
hung the shapeless and almost spectral box-coats of
departed travellers, long since buried in deep sleep. I only
heard the ticking of the clock, with the deep-drawn
breathing of the sleeping toper, and the dripping of the
rain, drop—drop—drop, from the eaves of the house.</p>

<p class='c009'>The church bells chimed midnight. All at once the
Stout Gentleman began to walk overhead, pacing slowly
backwards and forwards. There was something extremely
awful in all this—especially to me in my state of nerves.
These ghastly great-coats, these guttural breathings, and
the creaking footsteps of the mysterious being. His steps
grew fainter and fainter, and at length died away. I
could bear it no longer; I was wound up to the desperation
of a hero of romance. “Be he who or what he may,”
said I to myself, “I’ll have a sight of him!” I seized a
chamber candle and hurried up to No. 13. The door
stood ajar. I hesitated—I entered—the room was deserted.
There stood a large, broad-bottomed elbow-chair at a table,
on which was an empty tumbler and a <i>Times</i> newspaper,
and the room smelt powerfully of Stilton cheese.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mysterious stranger had evidently but just retired.
I turned off to my room sorely disappointed. As I went
along the corridor I saw a large pair of boots, with dirty,
waxed tops, standing at the door of a bed-chamber. They
doubtless belonged to the unknown; but it would not do
to disturb so redoubtable a personage in his den; he might
discharge a pistol or something worse at my head. I went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>to bed therefore, and lay awake half the night in a terribly
nervous state; and even when I fell asleep I was still
haunted in my dreams by the idea of the Stout Gentleman
and his wax-topped boots.</p>

<p class='c009'>I slept rather late the next morning, and was awakened
by some stir and bustle in the house, which I could not at
first comprehend; until getting more awake, I found there
was a mail coach starting from the door. Suddenly there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>was a cry from below: “The gentleman has forgot his
umbrella; look for the gentleman’s umbrella in No. 13.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I heard an immediate scamper of a chambermaid along
the passage, and a shrill reply, as she ran, “Here it is!
here’s the gentleman’s umbrella!”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THAT WAS ALL I EVER SAW OF THE STOUT GENTLEMAN.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The mysterious stranger then was on the point of setting
off. This was the only chance I should ever have of
knowing him. I sprang out of bed, scrambled to the
window, snatched aside the curtains, and just caught a
glimpse of the rear of a person getting in at the coach-door.
The skirts of a brown coat parted behind, and gave me a
full view of the broad disc of a pair of drab breeches.
The door closed. “All right,” was the word; the coach
whirled off—and that was all I ever saw of the Stout
Gentleman.</p>

    <div>SECOND WEEK.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>NEXT to deciding when to start your garden, the most
important matter is, what to put in it. It is difficult
to decide what to order for dinner on a given day: how
much more oppressive is it to order in a lump an endless
vista of dinners, so to speak! For, unless your garden is a
boundless prairie (and mine seems to me to be that when I
hoe it on hot days), you must make a selection, from the
great variety of vegetables, of those you will raise in it; and
you feel rather bound to supply your own table from your
own garden, and to eat only as you have sown.</p>
<p class='c009'>I hold that no man has a right (whatever his sex, of
course) to have a garden to his own selfish uses. He
ought not to please himself, but every man to please his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>neighbour. I tried to have a garden that would give
general moral satisfaction. It seemed to me that nobody
could object to potatoes (a most useful vegetable); and
I began to plant them freely. But there was a chorus of
protest against them. “You don’t want to take up your
ground with potatoes,” the neighbours said: “you can buy
potatoes” (the very thing I wanted to avoid doing is buying
things). “What you want is the perishable things that
you cannot get fresh in the market.”—“But what kind of
perishable things?” A horticulturist of eminence wanted
me to sow lines of strawberries and raspberries right over
where I had put my potatoes in drills. I had about five
hundred strawberry-plants in another part of my garden;
but this fruit-fanatic wanted me to turn my whole patch into
vines and runners. I suppose I could raise strawberries
enough for all my neighbours; and perhaps I ought to do
it. I had a little space prepared for melons,—musk-melons,—which
I showed to an experienced friend. “You are
not going to waste your ground on musk-melons?” he
asked. “They rarely ripen in this climate thoroughly,
before frost.” He had tried for years without luck. I
resolved not to go into such a foolish experiment. But, the
next day, another neighbour happened in. “Ah! I see
you are going to have melons. My family would rather
give up anything else in the garden than musk-melons,—of
the nutmeg variety. They are the most grateful things we
have on the table.” So there it was. There was no compromise:
it was melons or no melons, and somebody
offended in any case. I half resolved to plant them a little
late, so that they would, and they wouldn’t. But I had the
same difficulty about string-beans (which I detest), and
squash (which I tolerate), and parsnips, and the whole
round of green things.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have pretty much come to the conclusion that you
have got to put your foot down in gardening. If I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>actually taken counsel of my friends, I should not have had
a thing growing in the garden to-day but weeds. And
besides, while you are waiting, Nature does not wait. Her
mind is made up. She knows just what she will raise; and
she has an infinite variety of early and late. The most
humiliating thing to me about a garden is the lesson it
teaches of the inferiority of man. Nature is prompt,
decided, inexhaustible. She thrusts up her plants with
a vigour and freedom that I admire; and the more worthless
the plant, the more rapid and splendid its growth.
She is at it early and late, and all night; never tiring, nor
showing the least sign of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eternal gardening is the price of liberty,” is a motto
that I should put over the gateway of my garden, if I had a
gate. And yet it is not wholly true; for there is no liberty
in gardening. The man who undertakes a garden is relentlessly
pursued. He felicitates himself that, when he gets
it once planted, he will have a season of rest and of enjoyment
in the sprouting and growing of his seeds. It is a
green anticipation. He has planted a seed that will keep
him awake nights, drive rest from his bones, and sleep
from his pillow. Hardly is the garden planted, when he
must begin to hoe it. The weeds have sprung up all over
it in a night. They shine and wave in redundant life.
The docks have almost gone to seed; and their roots go
deeper than conscience. Talk about the London Docks!—the
roots of these are like the sources of the Aryan race.
And the weeds are not all. I awake in the morning (and
a thriving garden will wake a person up two hours before he
ought to be out of bed), and think of the tomato-plants,—the
leaves like fine lace-work, owing to black bugs that skip
around, and can’t be caught. Somebody ought to get up
before the dew is off (why don’t the dew stay on till after a
reasonable breakfast?) and sprinkle soot on the leaves. I
wonder if it is I. Soot is so much blacker than the bugs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>that they are disgusted, and go away. You can’t get up
too early if you have a garden. You must be early due
yourself, if you get ahead of the bugs. I think that, on the
whole, it would be best to sit up all night, and sleep day-times.
Things appear to go on in the night in the garden
uncommonly. It would be less trouble to stay up than it is
to get up so early.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“WHEN THEY BREAK INTO THE GARDEN.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I have been setting out some new raspberries, two sorts,—a
silver and a gold colour. How fine they will look on
the table next year in a cut-glass dish, the cream being in a
ditto pitcher! I set them four and five feet apart. I set
my strawberries pretty well apart also. The reason is, to
give room for the cows to run through when they break
into the garden,—as they do sometimes. A cow needs a
broader track than a locomotive; and she generally makes
one. I am sometimes astonished to see how big a space in
a flower-bed her foot will cover. The raspberries are called
Doolittle and Golden Cap. I don’t like the name of the
first variety, and, if they do much, shall change it to Silver
Top. You never can tell what a thing named Doolittle will
do. The one in the Senate changed colour, and got sour.
They ripen badly,—either mildew, or rot on the bush.
They are apt to Johnsonise,—rot on the stem. I shall
watch the Doolittles.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THESE TWO SAT AND WATCHED MY VIGOROUS COMBATS WITH THE WEEDS.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>O<span class='fss'>RTHODOXY</span> is at a low ebb. Only two clergymen
accepted my offer to come and help hoe my potatoes for
the privilege of using my vegetable total-depravity figure
about the snake-grass, or quack-grass, as some call it; and
those two did not bring hoes. There seems to be a lack of
disposition to hoe among our educated clergy. I am bound
to say that these two, however, sat and watched my vigorous
combats with the weeds, and talked most beautifully about
the application of the snake-grass figure. As, for instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>when a fault or sin showed on the surface of a man, whether
if you dug down, you would find that it ran back and into
the original organic bunch of original sin within the man.
The only other clergyman who came was from out of town,—a
half Universalist, who said he wouldn’t give twenty
cents for my figure. He said that the snake-grass was not
in my garden originally, that it sneaked in under the sod,
and that it could be entirely rooted out with industry and
patience. I asked the Universalist-inclined man to take my
hoe and try it; but he said he hadn’t time, and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, <i>jubilate</i>, I have got my garden all hoed the first
time! I feel as if I had put down the rebellion. Only
there are guerillas left here and there, about the borders
and in corners, unsubdued,—Forrest docks, and Quantrell
grass, and Beauregard pig-weeds. This first hoeing is a
gigantic task: it is your first trial of strength with the never-sleeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>forces of Nature. Several times, in its progress, I
was tempted to do as Adam did, who abandoned his garden
on account of the weeds. (How much my mind seems to
run upon Adam, as if there had been only two really moral
gardens,—Adam’s and mine!) The only drawback to my
rejoicing over the finishing of the first hoeing is, that the
garden now wants hoeing the second time. I suppose, if
my garden were planted in a perfect circle, and I started
round it with a hoe, I should never see an opportunity to
rest. The fact is, that gardening is the old fable of perpetual
labour: and I, for one, can never forgive Adam
Sisyphus, or whoever it was, who let in the roots of discord.
I had pictured myself sitting at eve, with my family, in the
shade of twilight, contemplating a garden hoed. Alas! it is
a dream not to be realised in this world.</p>

<p class='c009'>My mind has been turned to the subject of fruit and
shade trees in a garden. There are those who say that
trees shade the garden too much, and interfere with the
growth of the vegetables. There may be something in this:
but when I go down the potato rows, the rays of the sun
glancing upon my shining blade, the sweat pouring from my
face, I should be grateful for shade. What is a garden for?
The pleasure of man. I should take much more pleasure
in a shady garden. Am I to be sacrificed, broiled, roasted,
for the sake of the increased vigour of a few vegetables?
The thing is perfectly absurd. If I were rich, I think I
would have my garden covered with an awning, so that it
would be comfortable to work in it. It might roll up and
be removable, as the great awning of the Roman Coliseum
was,—not like the Boston one, which went off in a high
wind. Another very good way to do, and probably not so
expensive as the awning, would be to have four persons of
foreign birth carry a sort of canopy over you as you hoed.
And there might be a person at each end of the row with
some cool and refreshing drink. Agriculture is still in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>very barbarous stage. I hope to live yet to see the day
when I can do my gardening, as tragedy is done, to slow
and soothing music, and attended by some of the comforts
I have named. These things come so forcibly into my
mind sometimes as I work, that perhaps, when a wandering
breeze lifts my straw hat, or a bird lights on a near currant-bush
and shakes out a full-throated summer-song, I almost
expect to find the cooling drink and the hospitable entertainment
at the end of the row. But I never do. There
is nothing to be done but to turn round, and hoe back to
the other end.</p>

<p class='c009'>Speaking of those yellow squash-bugs, I think I disheartened
them by covering the plants so deep with soot
and wood-ashes that they could not find them; and I am
in doubt if I shall ever see the plants again. But I have
heard of another defence against the bugs. Put a fine
wire-screen over each hill, which will keep out the bugs,
and admit the rain. I should say that these screens would
not cost much more than the melons you would be likely
to get from the vines if you bought them; but then think
of the moral satisfaction of watching the bugs hovering
over the screen, seeing, but unable to reach the tender
plants within. That is worth paying for.</p>

<p class='c009'>I left my own garden yesterday, and went over to where
Polly was getting the weeds out of one of her flower-beds.
She was working away at the bed with a little hoe. Whether
women ought to have the ballot or not (and I have a
decided opinion on that point, which I should here plainly
give, did I not fear that it would injure my agricultural
influence), I am compelled to say that this was rather helpless
hoeing. It was patient, conscientious, even pathetic
hoeing; but it was neither effective nor finished. When
completed, the bed looked somewhat as if a hen had
scratched it: there was that touching unevenness about it.
I think no one could look at it and not be affected. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>be sure, Polly smoothed it off with a rake, and asked me if
it wasn’t nice; and I said it was. It was not a favourable
time for me to explain the difference between puttering
hoeing, and the broad, free sweep of the instrument, which
kills the weeds, spares the plants, and loosens the soil
without leaving it in holes and hills. But, after all, as life
is constituted, I think more of Polly’s honest and anxious
care of her plants than of the most finished gardening in
the world.</p>

    <div>SIXTH WEEK.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Somebody has sent me a new sort of hoe, with the wish
that I should speak favourably of it, if I can consistently.
I willingly do so, but with the understanding that I am to be
at liberty to speak just as courteously of any other hoe which
I may receive. If I understand religious morals, this is the
position of the religious press with regard to bitters and
wringing-machines. In some cases, the responsibility of
such a recommendation is shifted upon the wife of the
editor or clergyman. Polly says she is entirely willing to
make a certificate, accompanied with an affidavit, with
regard to this hoe; but her habit of sitting about the garden-walk,
on an inverted flower-pot, while I hoe, somewhat
destroys the practical value of her testimony.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to this hoe, I do not mind saying that it has changed
my view of the desirableness and value of human life.
It has, in fact, made life a holiday to me. It is
made on the principle that man is an upright, sensible,
reasonable being, and not a grovelling wretch. It does
away with the necessity of the hinge in the back. The
handle is seven and a half feet long. There are two
narrow blades, sharp on both edges, which come together
at an obtuse angle in front; and as you walk along with
this hoe before you, pushing and pulling with a gentle
motion, the weeds fall at every thrust and withdrawal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and the slaughter is immediate and widespread. When
I got this hoe, I was troubled with sleepless mornings,
pains in the back, kleptomania with regard to new
weeders; when I went into my garden, I was always
sure to see something. In this disordered state of
mind and body I got this hoe. The morning after a
day of using it I slept perfectly and late. I regained my
respect for the eighth commandment. After two doses of
the hoe in the garden the weeds entirely disappeared.
Trying it a third morning, I was obliged to throw it over
the fence, in order to save from destruction the green
things that ought to grow in the garden. Of course this
is figurative language. What I mean is, that the fascination
of using this hoe is such that you are sorely tempted to
employ it upon your vegetables after the weeds are laid low
and must hastily withdraw it to avoid unpleasant results. I
make this explanation because I intend to put nothing into
these agricultural papers that will not bear the strictest
scientific investigation; nothing that the youngest child
cannot understand and cry for; nothing that the oldest and
wisest men will not need to study with care.</p>

<p class='c009'>I need not add, that the care of a garden with this hoe
becomes the merest pastime. I would not be without one
for a single night. The only danger is, that you may rather
make an idol of the hoe, and somewhat neglect your garden
in explaining it, and fooling about with it. I almost think
that, with one of these in the hands of an ordinary day-labourer,
you might see at night where he had been
working.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us have peas. I have been a zealous advocate of
the birds. I have rejoiced in their multiplication. I have
endured their concerts at four o’clock in the morning
without a murmur. Let them come, I said, and eat the
worms, in order that we, later, may enjoy the foliage and
the fruits of the earth. We have a cat, a magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>animal, of the sex which votes (but not a pole-cat),—so
large and powerful that, if he were in the army, he would
be called Long Tom. He is a cat of fine disposition, the
most irreproachable morals I ever saw thrown away in a
cat, and a splendid hunter. He spends his nights, not in
social dissipation, but in gathering in rats, mice, flying-squirrels,
and also birds. When he first brought me a bird,
I told him that it was wrong, and tried to convince him,
while he was eating it, that he was doing wrong; for he is
a reasonable cat, and understands pretty much everything
except the binomial theorem and the time down the
cycloidal arc. But with no effect. The killing of birds
went on to my great regret and shame.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other day I went to my garden to get a mess of
peas. I had seen, the day before, that they were just ready
to pick. How I had lined the ground, planted, hoed,
bushed them! The bushes were very fine—seven feet
high, and of good wood. How I had delighted in the
growing, the blowing, the podding! What a touching
thought it was that they had all podded for me! When I
went to pick them, I found the pods all split open, and the
peas gone. The dear little birds, who are so fond of the
strawberries, had eaten them all. Perhaps there were left as
many as I planted: I did not count them. I made a rapid
estimate of the cost of the seed, the interest of the ground,
the price of labour, the value of the bushes, the anxiety of
weeks of watchfulness. I looked about me on the face of
Nature. The wind blew from the south so soft and
treacherous! A thrush sang in the woods so deceitfully!
All Nature seemed fair. But who was to give me back
my peas? The fowls of the air have peas; but what has
man?</p>

<p class='c009'>I went into the house. I called Calvin (that is the
name of our cat, given him on account of his gravity,
morality, and uprightness. We never familiarly call him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>John). I petted Calvin. I lavished upon him an enthusiastic
fondness. I told him that he had no fault; that the
one action that I had called a vice was an heroic exhibition
of regard for my interests. I bade him go and do likewise
continually. I now saw how much better instinct is than
mere unguided reason. Calvin knew. If he had put his
opinion into English (instead of his native catalogue), it
would have been: “You need not teach your grandmother
to suck eggs.” It was only the round of Nature. The
worms eat a noxious something in the ground. The birds
eat the worms. Calvin eats the birds. We eat—no, we do
not eat Calvin. There the chain stops. When you ascend
the scale of being, and come to an animal that is, like
ourselves, inedible, you have arrived at a result where you
can rest. Let us respect the cat, he completes an edible
chain.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have little heart to discuss methods of raising peas. It
occurs to me that I can have an iron pea-bush, a sort of
trellis, through which I could discharge electricity at frequent
intervals, and electrify the birds to death when they
alight; for they stand upon my beautiful bush, in order to
pick out the peas. An apparatus of this kind, with an
operator, would cost, however, about as much as the peas.
A neighbour suggests that I might put up a scarecrow near
the vines, which would keep the birds away. I am doubtful
about it: the birds are too much accustomed to seeing
a person in poor clothes in the garden to care much for
that. Another neighbour suggests that the birds do not
open the pods; that a sort of blast, apt to come after rain,
splits the pods, and the birds then eat the peas. It may be
so. There seems to be complete unity of action between
the blast and the birds. But good neighbours, kind friends,
I desire that you will not increase, by talk, a disappointment
which you cannot assuage.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>CAT-FISHING.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>MANY and ingenious are the remedies that have been
proposed for nocturnal cats, but none of them seem
to have proved thoroughly successful. It was pointed out
not very long ago that the extirpation of all fences which
run in a direction parallel, or nearly parallel, with the
Equator, would exempt cats from electrical difficulties in
their internal organs, and would thus hush the cries that
now render night hideous; but there is a practical difficulty
in dispensing with these fences. Another remedy, which is
a certain cure for nocturnal cats, is suggested by the fact
that cats cannot live at a greater elevation than 13,000 feet
above the sea. If we build our back fences 13,500 feet
high, not a cat will scale their lofty summits; but the labour
and expense of constructing fences of this height would be
so great as to forbid their erections by persons with small
incomes. Mere palliatives, such as bootjacks and lumps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of coal, never accomplished any lasting benefits; they may
discourage an occasional cat, but his place will instantly be
filled. With all their habitual caution, cats are bold, and
will often rush in where an average angel would fear to
tread. To deal effectually with them is a task which calls
for the highest form of inventive genius, combined with
patience and a reckless indifference to Mr. Bergh’s opinions.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“THE YOUNG MAN BECAME GREATLY FASCINATED WITH HIS NEW OCCUPATION.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>The young man in West Thirty-fifth Street who lately
introduced cat-fishing as a manly and beneficent sport, can
scarcely be said to have devised an absolute specific for
cats, but he has unquestionably contributed to lessen the
number of cats in his immediate vicinity. Early last fall
a vast area of cats, accompanied with marked depression
of the spirits of the inhabitants of West Thirty-fifth Street,
overspread that unfortunate region. After a thorough trial
of most of the popular remedies, a young man residing on
the block between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, and who may
be called—not necessarily for publication, but as a guarantee
of good faith—by the name of Thompson, hit upon the idea
of angling for cats. To the end of a strong blue-fish line he
affixed a salmon hook, baited with delicate morsels of meat.
At first this hook, deftly dropped from the back window,
was permitted to lie on top of the back fence. The first
cat that passed over the fence would investigate the bait,
and finding it apparently free from fraud, would begin to
eat it. A slight pull at the line would usually fix the hook
in the cat’s mouth, and the angler would haul in his prey
and knock it on the head. It frequently happened, however,
that the cat would not be successfully “struck,” and
would escape and warn his associates to beware of concealed
hooks. Moreover, the angler had his bait gorged,
upon one occasion, by a tramp, who had climbed the fence
with a view to gaining access to the kitchen; and though
the game was successfully landed in the second-storey back
room, and, after being goffed with a sword-bayonet, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>so much difficulty in subsequently disposing of the body
that he dreaded a repetition of the incident. He therefore
altered his methods of angling, and adopted a modified
style of fly-fishing.</p>

<p class='c009'>This latter sport was carried on with the aid of a long
bamboo fishing-pole. The hook was baited as before, but
instead of being permitted to lie on the top of the fence,
was suffered to dangle in the air, about two feet above it.
As soon as a cat perceived the bait, he assumed with the
intense self-conceit characteristic of his race, that it was a
supernatural recognition of his extraordinary merits, and
could be fearlessly appropriated. In order to seize it he
was, of course, compelled to leap upwards, and it was very
seldom that he failed to hook himself. By this plan, not
only was the necessity of “striking” the cat obviated, but
the danger that the bait would be seized by tramps was
greatly lessened, while the excitement and interest of the
sport were increased.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young man became greatly fascinated with his new
occupation, and having effected an arrangement with a
popular French restaurant, was enabled to dispose of his
game easily and profitably. On moonlight nights, when
the late fall cats were in season, he often caught a string
of from three to four dozen during a single night,—many
of these weighing ten or fifteen pounds each. So few cats
escaped after having once leaped at the bait, that no
general suspicion of the deadly nature of apparently aerial
meat was disseminated among the feline population of the
neighbourhood. Before the winter was over cats had
become so scarce that the sportsman was seriously contemplating
the necessity of artificially stocking the back fences
of Thirty-fifth Street, when an unfortunate accident brought
his beneficent occupation to a sudden end. An old gentleman,
residing in a house in Thirty-sixth Street, the backyard
of which adjoined the fence where the young man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>practised his sport, noticed one evening that something
attached to a string was dangling over his back fence. As
he had a pretty daughter, he immediately suspected that
it was a surreptitious note, and stole softly out to seize
and confiscate it. Mounting on a barrel he clutched
the supposed note, and was instantly hooked. The tackle
was strong, and he would perhaps have been landed had
not the hook torn out when he was about forty feet from
the ground. After he had recovered from his injuries
caused by the fall, and the weakness consequent upon
the amputation of his legs, he showed so much annoyance
at the so-called outrage which had been inflicted upon
him, that the young man, who was a person of most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>delicate feelings, promised to give up cat-fishing. Of
course, had the old gentleman been thoroughly gaffed, he
would not have fallen, and perhaps the young man felt
that his failure to properly gaff him was an inexcusable
error, which really called for his graceful retirement from
cat-fishing.</p>

<p class='c009'>This example ought to bear fruit. At a very small
expense for tackle, any resident of this city who occupies
a back room can secure excellent sport, and at the same
time can render a great service to humanity by reducing
the number of cats. The sport ought speedily to become
a very popular one, and there can be but little doubt that
in time cat-fishing will rival trout-fishing in the estimation
of American sportsmen.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>CAPTAIN STICK AND TONY.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>OLD Captain Stick was a remarkably precise old
gentleman and conscientiously just man. He was,
too, very methodical in his habits, one of which was to
keep an account in writing of the conduct of his servants,
from day to day. It was a sort of account-current, and he
settled by it every Saturday afternoon. No one dreaded
these hebdomadal balancings more than Tony, the boy of
all-work, for the captain was generally obliged to write a
receipt, for a considerable amount, across his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>One settling afternoon, the captain, accompanied by
Tony, was seen “toddling” down to the old stable, with
his little account book in one hand and a small rope in the
other. After they had reached the “Bar of Justice,” and
Tony had been properly “strung up,” the captain proceeded
to state his accounts as follows:—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“Tony, <i>Dr.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Sabbath</i>, to not half blacking my boots, etc., five stripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Tuesday</i>, to staying four hours at mill longer than necessary,
ten stripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Wednesday</i>, to not locking the hall door at night, five
stripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Friday</i>, to letting the horse go without water, five stripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Total, twenty-five stripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tony, <i>Cr.</i></p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Monday</i>, by first-rate day’s work in the garden, ten stripes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Balance due, fifteen stripes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The balance being thus struck, the captain drew his cowhide
and remarked——“Now, Tony, you black scamp, what
say you, you lazy villain, why I shouldn’t give you fifteen
lashes across your back, as hard as I can draw?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop, ole mass,” said Tony; “dar’s de work in de
garden, sir—dat ought to tek some off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You black dog,” said the captain, “haven’t I given you
the proper credit of ten stripes for that? Come, come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Please, ole massa,” said Tony, rolling his eyes about
in agony of fright—“dar’s—you forgot—dar’s de scourin

before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Soho, you saucy rascal,” quoth Captain Stick, “you’re
bringing in more offsets, are you? Well, now, there!”
Here the captain made an entry upon his book. “You
have a credit of five stripes, and the balance must be paid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gor a mity, massa, don’t hit yet—dar’s sumpen else—oh,

<p class='c009'>“That’s a fact,” said the captain; “the outrageous young
vagabond—that’s a fact, and I’ll give you credit of <i>ten</i>
stripes for it. I wish you had brought him to <i>me</i>. Now,
we’ll settle the balance.”</p>

Tony grinned extravagantly. The captain adjusted his
tortoise-shell spectacles with great exactness, held the book
close to his eyes, and ascertained that the fact was as stated
by Tony. He was not a little irritated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You swear off the account, you infernal rascal—you
swear off the account, do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All de credit is fair, ole massa,” answered Tony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but”—said the disappointed captain—“but—but,”—still
the captain was sorely puzzled how to give Tony
a <i>few licks</i> anyhow; “but——” An idea popped into his
head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Where’s my costs</i>, you incorrigible, abominable scoundrel?
You want to swindle me, do you, out of my costs, you
black deceitful rascal? And,” added Captain Stick,
chuckling as well at his own ingenuity as the perfect justice
of the sentence, “I enter judgment against you for costs—ten
stripes,” and forthwith administered the stripes and
satisfied the judgment.  “Ki’ nigger!” said Tony, “ki’

He was met at the hotel by Sheriff Knogg, who leaves a

<p class='c025'>Dave walked down the street to the bridge, and it
reminded one of old times to see the people go away as he
heaved in view. It was not through any fear of the man,
but from knowledge that he had made a threat (first
published in this paper) to clean out the town. Before

<p><span class='small'>“THE JUDGE WAS GRATIFIED TO FIND THAT HIS HAIR HAD RETURNED.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I&nbsp;HAVE been the victim of a somewhat singular persecution
for several weeks past. When we came here to
live, Judge Pitman was partially bald. Somebody induced
him to apply to his head a hair restorative made by a
Chicago man named Pulsifer. After using this liquid for a
few months the judge was gratified to find that his hair had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>returned; and as he naturally regarded the remedy with
admiration, he concluded that it would be simply fair to
give expression to his feelings in some form. As I happened
to be familiar with all the facts of the case, the judge
induced me to draw up a certificate affirming them over
my signature. This he mailed to Pulsifer. I have not yet
ceased to regret the weakness which permitted me to stand
sponsor for Judge Pitman’s hair. Of course, Pulsifer
immediately inserted the certificate, with my name and
residence attached to it, in half the papers in the country,
as a displayed advertisement, beginning with the words,
“<i>Hope for the bald-headed; the most remarkable cure on
record</i>,” in the largest capital letters.</p>
<p class='c009'>I have had faith in advertising since that time; and
Pulsifer had confidence in it too, for he wrote to me to
know what I would take to get him up a series of similar
certificates of cures performed by his other patent medicines.
He had a Corn Salve which dragged a little in its sales, and
he was prepared to offer me a commission if I would write
him a strong letter to the effect that six or eight frightful
corns had been eradicated from my feet with his admirable
preparation. He was in a position also to do something
handsome if I could describe a few miraculous cures that
had been effected by his Rheumatic Lotion, or if I would
name certain ruined stomachs which had, as it were, been
born again through the influence of Pulsifer’s Herb Bitters;
and from the manner in which he wrote, I think he would
have taken me into partnership if I had consented to write
an assurance that his Ready Relief had healed a bad leg of
eighteen years standing, and that I could never feel that my
duty was honourably performed until he sent me a dozen
bottles more for distribution among my friends whose legs
were in that defective and tiresome condition. I was
obliged to decline Pulsifer’s generous offer.</p>

<p class='c009'>I heard with singular promptness from other medical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>men. Fillemup &amp; Killem forwarded some of their Hair
Tonic, with a request for me to try it on any bald heads
I happened to encounter, and report. Doser &amp; Co. sent
on two packages of their Capillary Pills, with a suggestion
to the effect that if Pitman lost his hair again he would
get it back finally by following the enclosed directions. I
also heard from Brown &amp; Bromley, the agents for Johnson’s
Scalp Awakener. They sent me twelve bottles for distribution
among my bald friends. Then Smith &amp; Smithson
wrote to say that a cask of their Vesuvian Wash for the hair
would be delivered in my cellar by the Express Company;
and a man called on me from Jones, Butler, &amp; Co., with
a proposition to pump out my vinegar barrel, and fill it with
Balm of Peru for the gratuitous use of the afflicted in the
vicinity.</p>

<p class='c009'>But this persecution was simply unalloyed felicity when
compared with the suffering that came in other forms. I
will not attempt to give the number of the letters I received.
I cherish a conviction that the mail received at our post-office
doubled the first week after Judge Pitman’s cure was
announced to a hairless world. I think every bald-headed
man in the Tropic of Cancer must have written to me at
least twice upon the subject of Pulsifer’s Renovator and
Pitman’s hair. Persons dropped me a line to inquire if
Pitman’s baldness was hereditary; and if so, if it came from
his father’s or his mother’s side. One man, a phrenologist,
sent on a plaster head mapped out into town-lots, with
a suggestion that I should ink over the bumps that had
been barest and most fertile in the case of Pitman. He
said he had a little theory which he wanted to demonstrate.
A man in San Francisco wrote to inquire if my Pitman was
the same Pitman who came out to California in 1849 with
a bald head; and if he was, would I try to collect two
dollars Pitman had borrowed from him in that year? The
superintendent of a Sunday-school in Vermont forwarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>eight pages of foolscap covered with an argument supporting
the theory that it was impious to attempt to force hair
to grow upon a head which had been made bald, because,
although Elisha was bald, we find no record in the
Bible that he used renovator of any kind. He warned
Pitman to beware of Absalom’s fate, and to avoid riding
mules out in the woods. A woman in Snyder County,
Pennsylvania, sent me a poem inspired by the incident,
and entitled “Lines on the Return of Pitman’s Hair.” A
party in Kansas desired to know whether I thought Pulsifer’s
Renovator could be used beneficially by a man who had
been scalped. Two men in New Jersey wrote, in a manner
totally irrelevant to the subject, to inquire if I could get
each of them a good hired girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>I received a confidential letter from a man who was
willing to let me into a “good thing” if I had five hundred
dollars cash capital. Mrs. Singerly, of Frankford, related
that she had shaved her dog, and shaved him too close, and
she would be relieved if I would inform her if the Renovator
would make hair grow on a dog. A devoted mother in
Rhode Island said her little boy had accidentally drank
a bottle of the stuff, and she would go mad unless I could
assure her that there was no danger of her child having his
stomach choked up with hair. And over eleven hundred
boys inquired what effect the Renovator would have on the
growth of whiskers which betrayed an inclination to stagnation.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“SOME BALD-HEADED MISCREANT WOULD STOP ME IN THE MIDST OF THE DANCE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But the visitors were a more horrible torment. Bald
men came to see me in droves. They persecuted me at
home and abroad. If I went to church, the sexton would
call me out during the prayers to see a man in the vestibule
who wished to ascertain if Pitman merely bathed his head
or rubbed the medicine in with a brush. When I went to a
party, some bald-headed miscreant would stop me in the
midst of the dance to ask if Pitman’s hair began to grow in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the full of the moon or when it was new. While I was
being shaved, some one would bolt into the shop and insist,
as the barber held me by the nose, upon knowing whether
Pitman wore ventilators in his hat. If I attended a wedding,
as likely as not a bare-headed outlaw would stand by me at
the altar and ask if Pitman ever slept in nightcaps; and
more than once I was called out of bed at night by wretches
who wished to learn, before they left the town, if I thought
it hurt the hair to part it behind.</p>

<p class='c009'>It became unendurable. I issued orders to the servants
to admit to the house no man with a bald head. But that
very day a stranger obtained admission to the parlour; and
when I went down to see him, he stepped softly around,
closed all the doors mysteriously, and asked me, in a
whisper, if any one could hear us. Then he pulled off
a wig; and handing me a microscope, he requested me to
examine his scalp and tell him if there was any hope. I
sent him over to see Pitman; and I gloat over the fact that
he bored Pitman for two hours with his baldness.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am sorry now that I ever wrote anything upon the
subject of his hair. A bald Pitman, I know, is less fascinating
than a Pitman with hair; but rather than have suffered
this misery, I would prefer a Pitman without an eye-winker,
or fuzz enough on him to make a camel’s-hair pencil. But
I shall hardly give another certificate of cure in any event.
If I should see a patent medicine man take a mummy
which died the year Joseph was sold into Egypt, and dose
it until it kicked off its rags and danced the polka mazurka
while it whistled the tune, I would die at the stake sooner
than acknowledge the miracle on paper. Pitman’s hair
winds me up as far as medical certificates are concerned.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>COLONEL MULBERRY SELLERS.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>COLONEL MULBERRY SELLERS was in his
“library,” which was his “drawing-room,” and was
also his “picture gallery,” and likewise his “workshop.”
Sometimes he called it by one of these names, sometimes
by another, according to occasion and circumstance.
He was constructing what seemed to be some kind of a
frail mechanical toy, and was apparently very much interested
in his work. He was a white-headed man now,
but otherwise he was as young, alert, buoyant, visionary,
and enterprising as ever. His loving old wife sat near
by, contentedly knitting and thinking, with a cat asleep in
her lap. The room was large, light, and had a comfortable
look—in fact, a home-like look—though the furniture was
of a humble sort, and not over-abundant, and the knick-knacks
and things that go to adorn a living-room not plenty
and not costly. But there were natural flowers, and there
was an abstract and unclassifiable something about the place
which betrayed the presence in the house of somebody with
a happy taste and an effective touch.</p>
<p class='c009'>Even the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow
without offence; in fact, they seemed to belong there, and
to add an attraction to the room—a fascination, anyway; for
whoever got his eye on one of them was like to gaze and suffer
till he died—you have seen that kind of pictures. Some of
these terrors were landscapes, some libelled the sea, some
were ostensible portraits, all were crimes. All the portraits
were recognisable as dead Americans of distinction, and yet,
through labelling, added by a daring hand, they were all
doing duty here as “Earls of Rossmore.” The newest one
had left the works as Andrew Jackson, but was doing its
best now as “Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore, Present Earl.”
On one wall was a cheap old railroad map of Warwickshire.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>This had been newly labelled, “The Rossmore Estates.”
On the opposite wall was another map, and this was the
most imposing decoration of the establishment, and the
first to catch a stranger’s attention, because of its great size.
It had once borne simply the title SIBERIA; but now the
word “FUTURE” had been written in front of that word.
There were other additions, in red ink—many cities, with
great populations set down, scattered over the vast country
at points where neither cities nor populations exist to-day.
One of these cities, with population placed at 1,500,000,
bore the name “Libertyorloffskoizalinski,” and there was a
still more populous one, centrally located and marked
“Capitol,” which bore the name “Freedomslovnaivenovich.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mansion—the Colonel’s usual name for the house—was
a rickety old two-storey frame of considerable size, which
had been painted, some time or other, but had nearly forgotten
it. It was away out in the ragged edge of Washington,
and had once been somebody’s country place. It had
a neglected yard around it, with a paling fence that needed
straightening up, in places, and a gate that would stay shut.
By the door-post were several modest tin signs. “Col.
Mulberry Sellers, Attorney-at-Law and Claim Agent,” was
the principal one. One learned from the others that the
Colonel was a Materialiser, a Hypnotiser, a Mind-cure
dabbler, and so on. For he was a man who could always
find things to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>A white-headed negro man, with spectacles and damaged
white cotton gloves, appeared in the presence, made a
stately obeisance, and announced—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marse Washington Hawkins, suh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great Scott! Show him in, Dan’l, show him in.”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“A STOUTISH, DISCOURAGED-LOOKING MAN.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment,
and the next moment were joyfully wringing the hands of a
stoutish, discouraged-looking man, whose general aspect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>suggested that he was fifty years old, but whose hair swore
to a hundred.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well, well, Washington, my boy, it <i>is</i> good to
look at you again. Sit down, sit down, and make yourself
at home. There now—why, you look perfectly natural;
ageing a little, just a little, but you’d have known him anywhere,
wouldn’t you, Polly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, Berry, he’s <i>just</i> like his pa would have looked
if he’d lived. Dear, dear, where have you dropped from?
Let me see, how long is it since——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should say it’s all of fifteen years, Mrs. Sellers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, well, how time does get away with us. Yes, and
oh, the changes that——”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of
the lip, the men waiting reverently for her to get command
of herself and go on; but, after a little struggle, she turned
away with her apron to her eyes, and softly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seeing you made her think of the children, poor thing—dear,
dear, they’re all dead but the youngest. But
banish care, it’s no time for it now—on with the dance, let
joy be unconfided, is my motto—whether there’s any dance
to dance or any joy to unconfide, you’ll be the healthier for
it every time—every time, Washington—it’s my experience,
and I’ve seen a good deal of this world. Come, where have
you disappeared to all these years, and are you from there
now, or where are you from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t quite think you would ever guess, Colonel.
Cherokee Strip.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My land!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure as you live.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You can’t mean it. Actually <i>living</i> out there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes, if a body may call it that; though it’s a
pretty strong term for ’dobies and jackass rabbits, boiled
beans and slap-jacks, depression, withered hopes, poverty in
all its varieties——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Louise out there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and the children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Out there now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I couldn’t afford to bring them with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I see—you had to come—claim against the
Government. Make yourself perfectly easy—I’ll take care
of that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it isn’t a claim against the Government.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No? Want to be a postmaster? <i>That’s</i> all right.
Leave it to me. I’ll fix it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it isn’t postmaster—you’re all astray yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, good gracious, Washington, why don’t you come
out and tell me what it is? What do you want to be so
reserved and distrustful with an old friend like me for?
Don’t you reckon I can keep a se——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There’s no secret about it—you merely don’t give me a
chance to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, look here, old friend, I know the human race;
and I know that when a man comes to Washington, I don’t
care if it’s from heaven, let alone Cherokee Strip, it’s
because he <i>wants</i> something. And I know that as a rule
he’s not going to get it; that he’ll stay and try for another
thing and won’t get that; the same luck with the next and
the next and the next; and keeps on till he strikes bottom,
and is too poor and ashamed to go back, even to Cherokee
Strip; and at last his heart breaks and they take up a
collection and bury him. There—don’t interrupt me, I
know what I’m talking about. Happy and prosperous in
the Far West, wasn’t I? <i>You</i> know that. Principal

autocrat, actually a kind of an autocrat, Washington.
Well, nothing would do but I must go as Minister

of it, <i>had</i> to do it, so here I came. <i>A day too late</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Washington. Think of that—what little things change the
world’s history—yes, sir, the place had been filled. Well,
there I was, you see. I offered to compromise and go to
Paris. The President was very sorry and all that, but that
place, you see, didn’t belong to the West, so there I was
again. There was no help for it, so I had to stoop a little—we
all reach the day some time or other when we’ve got
to do that, Washington, and it’s not a bad thing for us,
either, take it by and large all around—I had to stoop a
little and offer to take Constantinople, Washington, consider
this—for it’s perfectly true—within a month I <i>asked</i>
for China; within another month I <i>begged</i> for Japan; one
year later I was away down, down, down, supplicating with
tears and anguish for the bottom office in the gift of the
Government of the United States—Flint-picker in the cellars
of the War Department. And by George I didn’t get it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Flint-picker?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. Office established in the time of the Revolution,
last century. The musket-flints for the military posts were
supplied from the capitol. They do it yet; for although
the flint-arm has gone out and the forts have tumbled down,
the decree hasn’t been repealed—been overlooked and forgotten,
you see—and so the vacancies where old Ticonderoga
and others used to stand still get their six quarts of
gun-flints a year just the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Washington said musingly after a pause:</p>

<p class='c009'>“How strange it seems—to start for Minister to England
at twenty thousand a year and fail for flint-picker at——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three dollars a week. It’s human life, Washington—just
an epitome of human ambition, and struggle, and the
outcome; you aim for the palace and get drowned in the
sewer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was another meditative silence. Then Washington
said, with earnest compassion in his voice—</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so, after coming here, against your inclination, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>satisfy your sense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish
public clamour, you get absolutely nothing for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing?” The Colonel had to get up and stand,
to get room for his amazement to expand. “<i>Nothing</i>,
Washington? I ask you this: to be a Perpetual Member
and the <i>only</i> Perpetual Member of a Diplomatic Body
accredited to the greatest country on earth—do you call
that nothing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Washington’s turn to be amazed. He was
stricken dumb; but the wide-eyed wonder, the reverent
admiration expressed in his face, were more eloquent than
any words could have been. The Colonel’s wounded
spirit was healed, and he resumed his seat, pleased and
content. He leaned forward and said, impressively—</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was due to a man who had become for ever
conspicuous by an experience without precedent in the
history of the world?—a man made permanently and
diplomatically sacred, so to speak, by having been connected,
temporarily, through solicitation, with every single
diplomatic post in the roster of this government, from
Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the
Court of St. James all the way down to Consul to a guano
rock in the Straits of Sunda—salary payable in guano—which
disappeared by volcanic convulsion the day before
they got down to my name in the list of applicants.
Certainly something august enough to be answerable to the
size of this unique and memorable experience was my due,
and I got it. By the common voice of this community, by
acclamation of the people, that mighty utterance which
brushes aside laws and legislation, and from whose decrees
there is no appeal, I was named Perpetual Member of the
Diplomatic Body, representing the multifarious sovereignties
and civilisations of the globe near the republican court
of the United States of America. And they brought me
home with a torchlight procession.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“It is wonderful, Colonel—simply wonderful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s the loftiest official position in the whole earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think so—and the most commanding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have named the word. Think of it. I frown,
and there is war; I smile, and contending nations lay down
their arms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is awful. The responsibility, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is nothing. Responsibility is no burden to me; I
am used to it; have always been used to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the work—the work! Do you have to attend all
the sittings?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who, I? Does the Emperor of Russia attend the
conclaves of the governors of the provinces? He sits at
home and indicates his pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Washington was silent a moment, then a deep sigh
escaped him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How proud I was an hour ago; how paltry seems my
little promotion now! Colonel, the reason I came to
Washington is—I am Congressional Delegate from
Cherokee Strip!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with
prodigious enthusiasm—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give me your hand, my boy—this is immense news!
I congratulate you with all my heart. My prophecies
stand confirmed. I always said it was in you. I always
said you were born for high distinction and would achieve
it. You ask Polly if I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Washington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Colonel, there’s nothing <i>to</i> it. That little, narrow,
desolate, unpeopled, oblong streak of grass and gravel, lost
in the remote wastes of the vast continent—why, it’s like
representing a billiard table—a discarded one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tut-tut, it’s a great, it’s a staving preferment, and just
opulent with influence here.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>“Shucks, Colonel, I haven’t even a vote.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s nothing, you can make speeches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I can’t. The population only two hundred——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s all right, that’s all right——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And they hadn’t any right to elect me; we’re not even
a territory, there’s no Organic Act, the government hasn’t
any official knowledge of us whatever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind about that; I’ll fix that. I’ll rush the
thing through, I’ll get you organised in no time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Will</i> you, Colonel?—it’s <i>too</i> good of you; but it’s just
your old sterling self, the same old, ever-faithful friend,”
and the grateful tears welled up in Washington’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s just as good as done, my boy, just as good as done.
Shake hands. We’ll hitch teams together, you and I, and
we’ll make things hum!”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>MESSIEURS,—You often entertain us with accounts of
new discoveries. Permit me to communicate to the
public, through your paper, one that has lately been made
by myself, and which I conceive may be of great utility.</p>
<p class='c009'>I was the other evening in a grand company, where the
new lamp of Messrs. Quinquet and Lange was introduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>and much admired for its splendour; but a general inquiry
was made, whether the oil it consumed was not in proportion
to the light it afforded, in which case there would be
no saving in the use of it. No one present could satisfy us
in that point, which all agreed ought to be known, it being
a very desirable thing to lessen, if possible, the expense of
lighting our apartments, when every other article of family
expense was so much augmented.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was pleased to see this general concern for economy,
for I love economy exceedingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went home, and to bed, three or four hours after midnight,
with my head full of the subject. An accidental
sudden noise waked me about six in the morning, when
I was surprised to find my room filled with light; and I
imagined at first that a number of those lamps had been
brought into it; but, rubbing my eyes, I perceived the light
came in at the windows. I got up and looked out to see
what might be the occasion of it, when I saw the sun just
rising above the horizon, from whence he poured his rays
plentifully into my chamber, my domestic having negligently
omitted, the preceding evening, to close the shutters.</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked at my watch, which goes very well, and found that
it was but six o’clock; and still thinking it something extraordinary
that the sun should rise so early, I looked into the
almanac, where I found it to be the hour given for his rising
on that day. I looked forward, too, and found he was to rise
still earlier every day till towards the end of June; and that
at no time in the year he retarded his rising so long as till
eight o’clock. Your readers who, with me, have never seen
any signs of sunshine before noon, and seldom regarded the
astronomical part of the almanac, will be as much astonished
as I was, when they hear of his rising so early, and especially
when I assure them, <i>that he gives light as soon as he rises</i>.
I am convinced of this. I am certain of my fact. One
cannot be more certain of any fact. I saw it with my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>eyes. And, having repeated this observation the three
following mornings, I found always precisely the same
result.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id032'>
<img src='images/ib196.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“WHEN I SPEAK OF THIS DISCOVERY TO OTHERS.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Yet so it happens that when I speak of this discovery to
others, I can easily perceive by their countenances, though
they forbear expressing it in words, that they do not quite
believe me. One, indeed, who is a learned natural
philosopher, has assured me that I must certainly be
mistaken as to the circumstance of the light coming into my
room; for it being well known, as he says, that there could
be no light abroad at that hour, it follows that none could
enter from without, and that of consequence, my windows
being accidentally left open, instead of letting in the light,
had only served to let out the darkness; and he used many
ingenious arguments to show me how I might, by that
means, have been deceived. I owned that he puzzled me
a little, but he did not satisfy me; and the subsequent
observations I made, as above mentioned, confirmed me in
my first opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>This event has given rise in my mind to several serious
and important reflections. I consider that if I had not
been awakened so early in the morning I should have slept
six hours longer by the light of the sun, and in exchange
have lived six hours the following night by candle-light; and
the latter being a much more expensive light than the
former, my love of economy induced me to muster up what
little arithmetic I was master of, and to make some calculations,
which I shall give you, after observing that utility is,
in my opinion, the test of value in matters of invention, and
that a discovery which can be applied to no use, or is not
good for something, is good for nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>I took for the basis of my calculation the supposition
that there are 100,000 families in Paris, and that these
families consume in the night half a pound of <i>bougies</i>, or
candles, per hour. I think this is a moderate allowance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>taking one family with another; for though I believe some
consume less, I know that many consume a great deal
more. Then estimating seven hours per day, as the
medium quantity between the time of the sun’s rising and
ours, he rising during the six following months from six to
eight hours before noon, and there being seven hours of
course per night in which we burn candles, the account will
stand thus:—</p>

<p class='c009'>An immense sum! that the city of Paris might save
every year, by the economy of using sunshine instead of
candles.</p>

<p class='c009'>If it should be said that people are apt to be obstinately
attached to old customs, and that it will be difficult to
induce them to rise before noon, consequently my discovery
can be of little use; I answer, <i>Nil desperandum</i>. I believe
all who have common sense, as soon as they have
learned from this paper that it is daylight when the sun
rises, will contrive to rise with him; and to compel the rest,
I would propose the following regulations:—</p>

<p class='c009'>First. Let a tax be laid of a louis per window on every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>window that is provided with shutters to keep out the light
of the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>Second. Let the same salutary operation of police be
made use of, to prevent our burning candles, that inclined
us last winter to be more economical in burning wood; that
is, let guards be placed in the shops of the wax and tallow
chandlers, and no family be permitted to be supplied with
more than one pound of candles per week.</p>

<p class='c009'>Third. Let guards also be posted to stop all the coaches,
etc., that would pass the street after sunset, except those of
physicians, surgeons, and midwives.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fourth. Every morning, as soon as the sun rises, let all
the bells in every church be set ringing; and if that is not
sufficient, let cannon be fired in every street, to wake the
sluggards effectually, and make them open their eyes to see
their true interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the difficulty will be in the first two or three days,
after which the reformation will be as natural and easy as
the present irregularity, for <i>ce n’est que le premier pas qui coûte</i>.
Oblige a man to rise at four in the morning, and it is more
than probable he will go willingly to bed at eight in the
evening; and, having had eight hours sleep, he will rise more
willingly at four in the morning following. But this sum
of ninety-six millions and seventy-five thousand livres is not
the whole of what may be saved by my economical project.
You may observe that I have calculated upon only one-half of
the year, and much may be saved in the other, though the days
are shorter. Besides, the immense stock of wax and tallow
left unconsumed during the summer will probably make
candles much cheaper for the ensuing winter, and continue
them cheaper as long as the proposed reformation shall be
supported.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the great benefit of this discovery, thus freely communicated
and bestowed by me on the public, I demand
neither place, pension, exclusive privilege, nor any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>reward whatever. I expect only to have the honour of it.
And yet I know there are little envious minds who will, as
usual, deny me this, and say that my invention was known
to the ancients, and perhaps they may bring passages out of
old books in proof of it. I will not dispute with these
people that the ancients knew not the sun would rise at
certain hours—they possibly had, as we have, almanacs
that predicted it—but it does not follow thence that they
knew <i>he gave light as soon as he rose</i>. This is what I claim
as my discovery. If the ancients knew it, it might have
been long since forgotten, for it certainly was unknown to
the moderns, at least to the Parisians, which to prove I
need use but one plain, simple argument. They are as well
instructed, judicious, and prudent a people as exist anywhere
in the world, all professing, like myself, to be lovers of
economy; and, from the many heavy taxes required from
them by the necessities of the state, have surely an abundant
reason to be economical. I say it is impossible that so
sensible a people, under such circumstances, should have
lived so long by the smoky, unwholesome, and enormously
expensive light of candles, if they had really known that
they might have had as much pure light of the sun for
nothing.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>MISS MEHETABEL’S SON.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>A MAN with a passion for <i>bric-à-brac</i> is always stumbling
over antique bronzes, intaglios, mosaics, and daggers
of the time of Benvenuto Cellini; the bibliophile finds
creamy vellum folios and rare Alduses and Elzevirs waiting
for him at unsuspected bookstalls; the numismatist has but
to stretch forth his palm to have priceless coins drop into
it. My own weakness is odd people, and I am constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>encountering them. It was plain I had unearthed a couple
of very queer specimens at Bayley’s Four Corners. I saw
that a fortnight afforded me too brief an opportunity to
develop the richness of both, and I resolved to devote my
spare time to Mr. Jaffrey alone, instinctively recognising in
him an unfamiliar species.</p>
<p class='c009'>My professional work in the vicinity of Greenton left my
evenings and occasionally an afternoon unoccupied; these
intervals I purposed to employ in studying and classifying
my fellow-boarder. It was necessary, as a preliminary step,
to learn something of his previous history, and to this end
I addressed myself to Mr. Sewell that same night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not want to seem inquisitive,” I said to the landlord,
as he was fastening up the bar, which, by the way,
was the <i>salle à manger</i> and general sitting-room. “I do
not want to seem inquisitive, but your friend Mr. Jaffrey
dropped a remark this morning at breakfast which—which
was not altogether clear to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“About Mehetabel?” asked Mr. Sewell uneasily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I wish he wouldn’t!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was friendly enough in the course of conversation
to hint to me that he had not married the young woman,
and seemed to regret it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, he didn’t marry Mehetabel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I inquire <i>why</i> he didn’t marry Mehetabel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never asked her. Might have married the girl forty
times. Old Elkin’s daughter over at K——, she’d have
had him quick enough. Seven years off and on, he kept
company with Mehetabel, and then she died.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And he never asked her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He shilly-shallied. Perhaps he didn’t think of it.
When she was dead and gone, then Silas was struck all
of a heap,—and that’s all about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Obviously Mr. Sewell did not intend to tell me anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>more, and obviously there was more to tell. The
topic was plainly disagreeable to him for some reason or
other, and that unknown reason of course piqued my
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I had been absent from dinner and supper that day,
I did not meet Mr. Jaffrey again until the following morning
at breakfast. He had recovered his bird-like manner, and
was full of a mysterious assassination that had just taken
place in New York, all the thrilling details of which were at
his fingers’ ends. It was at once comical and sad to see
this harmless old gentleman, with his naïve, benevolent
countenance, and his thin hair flaming up in a semicircle
like the foot-lights at a theatre, revelling in the intricacies of
the unmentionable deed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You come up to my room to-night,” he cried with
horrid glee, “and I’ll give you my theory of the murder.
I’ll make it as clear as day to you that it was the detective
himself who fired the three pistol-shots.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not so much the desire to have this point
elucidated as to make a closer study of Mr. Jaffrey that
led me to accept his invitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Jaffrey’s bedroom was in an L of the building, and
was in no way noticeable except for the numerous files of
newspapers neatly arranged against the blank spaces of the
walls, and a huge pile of old magazines which stood in one
corner, reaching nearly up to the ceiling, and threatening
each instant to topple over like the Leaning Tower at Pisa.
There were green paper shades at the windows, some faded
chintz valances about the bed, and two or three easy-chairs
covered with chintz. On a black walnut shelf between the
windows lay a choice collection of meerschaum and brierwood
pipes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Filling one of the chocolate-coloured bowls for me, and
another for himself, Mr. Jaffrey began prattling; but not
about the murder, which appeared to have flown out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>mind. In fact, I do not remember that the topic was even
touched upon, either then or afterwards.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Cosy nest this,” said Mr. Jaffrey, glancing complacently
over the apartment. “What is more cheerful, now, in the
fall of the year, than an open wood-fire? Do you hear
those little chirps and twitters coming out of that piece of
apple-wood? Those are the ghosts of the robins and
bluebirds that sang upon the bough when it was in blossom
last spring. In summer whole flocks of them come fluttering
about the fruit trees under the window; so I have
singing birds all the year round. I take it very easy here,
I can tell you, summer and winter. Not much society.
Tobias is not, perhaps, what one would term a great
intellectual force, but he means well. He’s a realist,
believes in coming down to what he calls ‘the hard pan;’
but his heart is in the right place, and he’s very kind to me.
The wisest thing I ever did in my life was to sell out my
grain business over at K——, thirteen years ago, and settle
down at the Corners. When a man has made a competency,
what does he want more? Besides, at that time an event
occurred which destroyed any ambition I may have had,—Mehetabel
died.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lady you were engaged to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“N-o, not precisely engaged. I think it was quite
understood between us, though nothing had been said
on the subject. Typhoid,” added Mr. Jaffrey, in a low
tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>For several minutes he smoked in silence, a vague,
troubled look playing over his countenance. Presently this
passed away, and he fixed his grey eyes speculatively upon
my face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I had married Mehetabel,” said Mr. Jaffrey, slowly,
and then he hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'>I blew a ring of smoke into the air, and, resting my pipe
on my knee, dropped into an attitude of attention.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“If I had married Mehetabel, you know, we should have
had—ahem!—a family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very likely,” I assented, vastly amused at this unexpected
turn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A boy!” exclaimed Mr. Jaffrey, explosively.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By all means, certainly, a son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Great trouble about naming the boy. Mehetabel’s
family want him named Elkanah Elkins, after her grandfather;
I want him named Andrew Jackson. We compromise
by christening him Elkanah Elkins Andrew Jackson
Jaffrey. Rather a long name for such a short little fellow,”
said Mr. Jaffrey, musingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Andy isn’t a bad nickname,” I suggested.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all. We call him Andy in the family. Somewhat
fractious at first,—colic and things. I suppose it is
right, or it wouldn’t be so; but the usefulness of measles,
mumps, croup, whooping-cough, scarlatina, and fits is not
visible to the naked eye. I wish Andy would be a model
infant, and dodge the whole lot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This supposititious child, born within the last few minutes,
was clearly assuming the proportions of a reality to Mr.
Jaffrey. I began to feel a little uncomfortable. I am,
as I have said, a civil engineer, and it is not strictly in
my line to assist at the births of infants, imaginary or
otherwise. I pulled away vigorously at the pipe and said
nothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What large blue eyes he has,” resumed Mr. Jaffrey, after
a pause; “just like Hetty’s; and the fair hair, too, like
hers. How oddly certain distinctive features are handed
down in families! sometimes a mouth, sometimes a turn of
the eyebrow. Wicked little boys, over at K——, have now
and then derisively advised me to follow my nose. It
would be an interesting thing to do. I should find my
nose flying about the world, turning up unexpectedly here
and there, dodging this branch of the family and reappearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>in that, now jumping over one great-grandchild to fasten
itself upon another, and never losing its individuality.
Look at Andy. There’s Elkanah Elkin’s chin to the life.
Andy’s chin is probably older than the Pyramids. Poor little
thing,” he cried, with a sudden, indescribable tenderness,
“to lose his mother so early!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And Mr. Jaffrey’s head sunk upon his breast, and his
shoulders slanted forward, as if he were actually bending
over the cradle of the child.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole gesture and attitude was so natural that it
startled me. The pipe slipped from my fingers and fell to
the floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush!” whispered Mr. Jaffrey, with a deprecating
motion of his hand. “Andy’s asleep!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose softly from the chair, and, walking across the
room on tiptoe, drew down the shade at the window through
which the moonlight was streaming. Then he returned to
his seat, and remained gazing with half-closed eyes into the
drooping embers.</p>

<p class='c009'>I refilled my pipe and smoked in profound silence,
wondering what would come next. But nothing came next.
Mr. Jaffrey had fallen into so brown a study, that, a quarter
of an hour afterwards, when I wished him good-night and
withdrew, I do not think he noticed my departure. I am
not what is called a man of imagination; it is my habit to
exclude most things not capable of mathematical demonstration;
but I am not without a certain psychological
insight, and I think I understood Mr. Jaffrey’s case.</p>

<p class='c009'>I could easily understand how a man with an unhealthy,
sensitive nature, overwhelmed by sudden calamity, might
take refuge in some forlorn place like this old tavern, and
dream his life away. To such a man—brooding for ever
on what might have been, and dwelling only in the realm of
his fancies—the actual world might indeed become as a
dream, and nothing seem real but his illusions.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>I daresay that thirteen years of Bayley’s Four Corners
would have its effect upon me; though instead of conjuring up
golden-haired children of the Madonna, I should probably see
gnomes and kobolds and goblins engaged in hoisting false
signals and misplacing switches for midnight express trains.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No doubt,” I said to myself that night, as I lay in bed,
thinking over the matter, “this once possible but now
impossible child is a great comfort to the old gentleman,—a
greater comfort, perhaps, than a real son would be.
Maybe Andy will vanish with the shades and mists of
night, he’s such an unsubstantial infant; but if he doesn’t,
and Mr. Jaffrey finds pleasure in talking to me about his
son, I shall humour the old fellow. It wouldn’t be a
Christian act to knock over his harmless fancy.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“MR. JAFFREY WHISPERED TO ME.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I was very impatient to see if Mr. Jaffrey’s illusion would
stand the test of daylight. It did. Elkanah Elkins Andrew
Jackson Jaffrey was, so to speak, alive and kicking the next
morning. On taking his seat at the breakfast-table, Mr.
Jaffrey whispered to me that Andy had had a comfortable
night.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Silas!” said Mr. Sewell, sharply, “what are you whispering
about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Sewell was in an ill humour; perhaps he was jealous
because I had passed the evening in Mr. Jaffrey’s room;
but surely Mr. Sewell could not expect his boarders to go
to bed at eight o’clock every night, as he did. From
time to time during the meal Mr. Sewell regarded me
unkindly out of the corner of his eye, and in helping
me to the parsnips he poniarded them with quite a
suggestive air. All this, however, did not prevent me from
repairing to the door of Mr. Jaffrey’s snuggery when night
came.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Mr. Jaffrey, how’s Andy this evening?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got a tooth!” cried Mr. Jaffrey, vivaciously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he has! Just through. Gave the nurse a silver
dollar. Standing reward for first tooth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was on the tip of my tongue to express surprise that
an infant a day old should cut a tooth, when I suddenly
recollected that Richard III. was born with teeth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Feeling myself to be on unfamiliar ground, I suppressed
my criticism. It was well I did so, for in the next breath I
was advised that half a year had elapsed since the previous
evening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Andy’s had a hard six months of it,” said Mr. Jaffrey,
with the well-known narrative air of fathers. “We’ve
brought him up by hand. His grandfather, by the way,
was brought up by the bottle”—and brought down by it,
too, I added mentally, recalling Mr. Sewell’s account of the
old gentleman’s tragic end.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Jaffrey then went on to give me a history of Andy’s
first six months, omitting no detail however insignificant or
irrelevant. This history I would in turn inflict upon the
reader, if I were only certain that he is one of those dreadful
parents who, under the ægis of friendship, bore you at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>street-corner with that remarkable thing which Freddy said
the other day, and insist on singing to you at an evening
party the Iliad of Tommy’s woes.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to inflict this <i>enfantillage</i> upon the unmarried reader
would be an act of wanton cruelty. So I pass over that
part of Andy’s biography, and, for the same reason, make
no record of the next four or five interviews I had with Mr.
Jaffrey. It will be sufficient to state that Andy glided from
extreme infancy to early youth with astonishing celerity,—at
the rate of one year per night, if I remember correctly;
and—must I confess it?—before the week came to an end,
this invisible hobgoblin of a boy was only little less of a
reality to me than to Mr. Jaffrey.</p>

<p class='c009'>At first I had lent myself to the old dreamer’s whim with
a keen perception of the humour of the thing; but by-and-by
I found I was talking and thinking of Miss Mehetabel’s
son as though he were a veritable personage. Mr. Jaffrey
spoke of the child with such an air of conviction!—as if
Andy were playing among his toys in the next room, or
making mud-pies down in the yard. In these conversations,
it should be observed, the child was never supposed to be
present, except on that single occasion when Mr. Jaffrey
leaned over the cradle. After one of our séances I would
lie awake until the small hours, thinking of the boy, and then
fall asleep only to have indigestible dreams about him.
Through the day, and sometimes in the midst of complicated
calculations, I would catch myself wondering what
Andy was up to now! There was no shaking him off; he
became an inseparable nightmare to me; and I felt that if I
remained much longer at Bayley’s Four Corners I should
turn into just such another bald-headed, mild-eyed visionary
as Silas Jaffrey.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the tavern was a gruesome old shell anyway, full
of unaccountable noises after dark,—rustlings of garments
along unfrequented passages, and stealthy footfalls in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>unoccupied chambers overhead. I never knew of an old
house without these mysterious noises.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next to my bedroom was a musty, dismantled apartment,
in one corner of which, leaning against the wainscot, was a
crippled mangle, with its iron crank tilted in the air like the
elbow of the late Mr. Clem Jaffrey. Sometimes,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>“In the dead vast and middle of the night,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I used to hear sounds as if some one were turning that
rusty crank on the sly. This occurred only on particularly
cold nights, and I conceived the uncomfortable idea that it
was the thin family ghosts, from the neglected graveyard in
the cornfield, keeping themselves warm by running each
other through the mangle. There was a haunted air about
the whole place that made it easy for me to believe in the
existence of a phantasm like Miss Mehetabel’s son, who,
after all, was less unearthly than Mr. Jaffrey himself, and
seemed more properly an inhabitant of this globe than the
toothless ogre who kept the inn, not to mention the silent
witch of Endor that cooked our meals for us over the bar-room
fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>In spite of the scowls and winks bestowed upon me by
Mr. Sewell, who let slip no opportunity to testify his disapprobation
of the intimacy, Mr. Jaffrey and I spent all
our evenings together—those long autumnal evenings,
through the length of which he talked about the boy, laying
out his path in life, and hedging the path with roses.
He should be sent to the High School at Portsmouth,
and then to college; he should be educated like a gentleman,
Andy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the old man dies,” said Mr. Jaffrey, rubbing his
hands gleefully, as if it were a great joke, “Andy will find
that the old man has left him a pretty plum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you think of having Andy enter West Point
when he’s old enough?” said Mr. Jaffrey, on another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>occasion. “He needn’t necessarily go into the army when
he graduates; he can become a civil engineer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was a stroke of flattery so delicate and indirect, that
I could accept it without immodesty.</p>

<p class='c009'>There had lately sprung up on the corner of Mr. Jaffrey’s
bureau a small tin house, Gothic in architecture, and pink
in colour, with a slit in the roof, and the word “Bank”
painted on one façade. Several times in the course of an
evening Mr. Jaffrey would rise from his chair, without
interrupting the conversation, and gravely drop a nickel
through the scuttle of the bank. It was pleasant to
observe the solemnity of his countenance as he approached
the edifice, and the air of triumph with which he resumed
his seat by the fireplace. One night I missed the tin bank.
It had disappeared, deposits and all. Evidently there had
been a defalcation on rather a large scale. I strongly
suspected that Mr. Sewell was at the bottom of it; but my
suspicion was not shared by Mr. Jaffrey, who, remarking
my glance at the bureau, became suddenly depressed.
“I’m afraid,” he said, “that I have failed to instil into
Andrew those principles of integrity—which—which——”
And the old gentleman quite broke down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Andy was now eight or nine years old, and for some time
past, if the truth must be told, had given Mr. Jaffrey no
inconsiderable trouble. What with his impishness and his
illnesses, the boy led the pair of us a lively dance. I shall
not soon forget the anxiety of Mr. Jaffrey the night Andy
had the scarlet fever,—an anxiety which so affected me that
I actually returned to the tavern the following afternoon
earlier than usual, dreading to hear the little spectre was
dead, and greatly relieved on meeting Mr. Jaffrey on the
door-step with his face wreathed in smiles. When I spoke
to him of Andy, I was made aware that I was inquiring
into a case of scarlet fever that had occurred the year
before!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>It was at this time, towards the end of my second week
at Greenton, that I noticed what was probably not a new
trait,—Mr. Jaffrey’s curious sensitiveness to atmospherical
changes. He was as sensitive as a barometer. The
approach of a storm sent his mercury down instantly.
When the weather was fair he was hopeful and sunny, and
Andy’s prospects were brilliant. When the weather was
overcast and threatening he grew restless and despondent,
and was afraid the boy wasn’t going to turn out well.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the Saturday previous to my departure, which had
been fixed for Monday, it had rained heavily all the afternoon,
and that night Mr. Jaffrey was in an unusually
excitable and unhappy frame of mind. His mercury was
very low indeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That boy is going to the dogs just as fast as he can go,”
said Mr. Jaffrey, with a woful face. “I can’t do anything
with him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’ll come out all right, Mr. Jaffrey. Boys will be
boys. I wouldn’t give a snap for a lad without animal
spirits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But animal spirits,” said Mr. Jaffrey, sententiously,
“shouldn’t saw off the legs of the piano in Tobias’s best
parlour. I don’t know what Tobias will say when he finds
it out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, has Andy sawed off the legs of the old spinet?”
I returned, laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Worse than that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Played upon it, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, sir. He has lied to me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t believe that of Andy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lied to me, sir,” repeated Mr. Jaffrey, severely. “He
pledged me his word of honour that he would give over his
climbing. The way that boy climbs sends a chill down my
spine. This morning, notwithstanding his solemn promise,
he shinned up the lightning-rod attached to the extension,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and sat astride the ridge-pole. I saw him, and he denied
it! When a boy you have caressed and indulged and
lavished pocket-money on lies to you, and <i>will</i> climb,
then there’s nothing more to be said. He’s a lost child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You take too dark a view of it, Mr. Jaffrey. Training
and education are bound to tell in the end, and he has been
well brought up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I didn’t bring him up on a lightning-rod, did I?
If he is ever going to know how to behave, he ought to
know now. To-morrow he will be eleven years old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The reflection came to me that if Andy had not been
brought up by the rod, he had certainly been brought up
by the lightning. He was eleven years old in two weeks!</p>

<p class='c009'>I essayed to tranquillise Mr. Jaffrey’s mind, and to give
him some practical hints on the management of youth, with
that perspicacious wisdom which seems to be the peculiar
property of bachelors and elderly maiden ladies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Spank him,” I suggested, at length.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will!” said the old gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you’d better do it at once!” I added, as it flashed
upon me that in six months Andy would be a hundred
and forty-three years old!—an age at which parental discipline
would have to be relaxed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning, Sunday, the rain came down as if
determined to drive the quicksilver entirely out of my poor
friend. Mr. Jaffrey sat bolt upright at the breakfast-table,
looking as woe-begone as a bust of Dante, and retired to
his chamber the moment the meal was finished. As the
day advanced, the wind veered round to the north-east, and
settled itself down to work. It was not pleasant to think,
and I tried not to think, what Mr. Jaffrey’s condition would
be if the weather did not mend its manners by noon; but
so far from clearing off at noon, the storm increased in
violence, and as night set in the wind whistled in a spiteful
falsetto key, and the rain lashed the old tavern as if it were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>a balky horse that refused to move on. The windows
rattled in the worm-eaten frames, and the doors of remote
rooms, where nobody ever went, slammed-to in the maddest
way. Now and then the tornado, sweeping down the side
of Mount Agamenticus, bowled across the open country
and struck the ancient hostelry point-blank.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Jaffrey did not appear at supper. I knew he was
expecting me to come to his room as usual, and I turned
over in my mind a dozen plans to evade seeing him that
night.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib213.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“AN ATROCIOUS WINK.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The landlord sat at the opposite side of the chimney-place,
with his eye upon me. I fancy he was aware of the
effect of this storm on his other boarder; for at intervals,
as the wind hurled itself against the exposed gable, threatening
to burst in the windows, Mr. Sewell tipped me an
atrocious wink, and displayed his gums in a way he had
not done since the morning after my arrival at Greenton.
I wondered if he suspected anything about Andy. There
had been odd times during the past week when I felt convinced
that the existence of Miss Mehetabel’s son was no
secret to Mr. Sewell.</p>

<p class='c009'>In deference to the gale, the landlord sat up half-an-hour
later than was his custom. At half-past eight he went to
bed, remarking that he thought the old pile would stand till
morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had been absent only a few minutes when I heard a
rustling at the door. I looked up and beheld Mr. Jaffrey
standing on the threshold, with his dress in disorder, his
scant hair flying, and the wildest expression on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s gone!” cried Mr. Jaffrey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who? Sewell! Yes, he just went to bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, not Tobias,—the boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, run away?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,—he is dead! He has fallen off a step-ladder in
the red chamber and broken his neck!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Mr. Jaffrey threw up his hands with a gesture of despair
and disappeared. I followed him through the hall, saw him
go into his own apartment, and heard the bolt of the door
drawn to. Then I returned to the bar-room and sat for an
hour or two in the ruddy glow of the fire, brooding over the
strange experience of the last fortnight.</p>

<p class='c009'>On my way to bed I paused at Mr. Jaffrey’s door, and, in
a lull of the storm, the measured respiration within told
me that the old gentleman was sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Slumber was coy with me that night. I lay listening to
the soughing of the wind and thinking of Mr. Jaffrey’s
illusion. It had amused me at first with its grotesqueness;
but now the poor little phantom was dead. I was conscious
that there had been something pathetic in it all along.
Shortly after midnight the wind sunk down, coming and
going fainter and fainter, floating around the eaves of the
tavern with a gentle, murmurous sound, as if it were turning
itself into soft wings to bear away the spirit of a little
child.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>Perhaps nothing that happened during my stay at Bayley’s
Four Corners took me so completely by surprise as Mr.
Jaffrey’s radiant countenance the next morning. The morning
itself was not fresher or sunnier. His round face
literally shone with geniality and happiness. His eyes
twinkled like diamonds, and the magnetic light of his hair
was turned on full. He came into my room while I was
packing my valise. He chirped and prattled and carolled,
and was sorry I was going away,—but never a word about
Andy. However, the boy had probably been dead several
years then!</p>

<p class='c009'>The open waggon that was to carry me to the station
stood at the door; Mr. Sewell was placing my case of instruments
under the seat, and Mr. Jaffrey had gone up to his
room to get me a certain newspaper containing an account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>of a remarkable shipwreck on the Auckland Islands. I
took the opportunity to thank Mr. Sewell for his courtesies
to me, and to express my regret at leaving him and Mr.
Jaffrey.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have become very much attached to Mr. Jaffrey,” I
said; “he is a most interesting person; but that hypothetical
boy of his, that son of Miss Mehetabel’s——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know!” interrupted Mr. Sewell, testily, “fell off
a step-ladder and broke his dratted neck. Eleven year old,
wasn’t he? Always does, jest at that point. Next week
Silas will begin the whole thing over again if he can get
anybody to listen to him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see; our amiable friend is a little queer on that
subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Sewell glanced cautiously over his shoulder, and,
tapping himself significantly on the forehead, said in a low
voice—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Room to let. Unfurnished!”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>“SAY, are you a Mason, or a Nodfellow, or anything?”
asked the bad boy of the grocery man, as he went to
the cinnamon bag on the shelf and took out a long stick of
cinnamon bark to chew.</p>
<p class='c009'>“Why, yes, of course I am; but what set you to thinking
of that?” asked the grocery man, as he went to the
desk and charged the boy’s father with a half-pound of
cinnamon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, do the goats bunt when you nishiate a fresh
candidate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, of course not. The goats are cheap ones, that
have no life, and we muzzle them, and put pillows over
their heads, so they can’t hurt anybody,” says the grocery
man, as he winked at a brother Oddfellow who was seated
on a sugar barrel, looking mysterious. “But why do you
ask?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Oh, nothin’, only I wish me and my chum had muzzled
our goat with a pillow. Pa would have enjoyed his becoming
a member of our lodge better. You see, Pa had
been telling us how much good the Masons and Oddfellers
did, and said we ought to try and grow up good so
we could jine the lodges when we got big; and I asked Pa
if it would do any hurt for us to have a play lodge in my
room, and purtend to nishiate, and Pa said it wouldn’t do
any hurt. He said it would improve our minds and learn
us to be men. So my chum and me borried a goat that
lives in a livery stable. Say, did you know they keep
a goat in a livery stable so the horses won’t get sick?
They get used to the smell of the goat, and after that
nothing can make them sick but a glue factory. You see
my chum and me had to carry the goat up to my room
when Ma and Pa was out riding, and he blatted so we had
to tie a handkerchief around his nose, and his feet made
such a noise on the floor that we put some baby’s socks on
his hoofs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my chum and me practised with that goat until
he could bunt the picture of a goat every time. We
borried a bock beer sign from a saloon man and hung it
on the back of a chair, and the goat would hit it every
time. That night Pa wanted to know what we were doing
up in my room, and I told him we were playing lodge, and
improving our minds; and Pa said that was right, there
was nothing that did boys of our age half so much good
as to imitate men, and store by useful nollidge. Then my
chum asked Pa if he didn’t want to come up and take the
grand bumper degree, and Pa laffed and said he didn’t
care if he did, just to encourage us boys in innocent pastime
that was so improving to our intellex. We had shut
the goat up in a closet in my room, and he had got over
blatting; so we took off the handkerchief, and he was
eating some of my paper collars and skate straps. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>went upstairs, and told Pa to come up pretty soon and
give three distinct raps, and when we asked him who comes
there he must say, ‘A pilgrim, who wants to join your
ancient order and ride the goat.’ Ma wanted to come
up, too, but we told her if she come in it would break
up the lodge, cause a woman couldn’t keep a secret,
and we didn’t have any side-saddle for the goat. Say,
if you never tried it, the next time you nishiate a man in
your Mason’s lodge you sprinkle a little kyan pepper on the
goat’s beard just afore you turn him loose. You can get
three times as much fun to the square inch of goat. You
wouldn’t think it was the same goat. Well, we got all
fixed and Pa rapped, and we let him in and told him he
must be blindfolded, and he got on his knees a laffing, and
I tied a towel around his eyes, and then I turned him
around and made him get down on his hands also, and
then his back was right towards the closet sign, and I put
the bock beer sign right against Pa’s clothes. He was a
laffing all the time, and said we boys were as full of fun as
they made ’em, and we told him it was a solemn occasion,
and we wouldn’t permit no levity, and if he didn’t stop
laffing we couldn’t give him the grand bumper degree.
Then everything was ready, and my chum had his hand
on the closet door, and some kyan pepper in his other
hand, and I asked Pa in low bass tones if he felt as
though he wanted to turn back, or if he had nerve enough
to go ahead and take the degree. I warned him that it
was full of dangers, as the goat was loaded for bear, and
told him he yet had time to retrace his steps if he wanted
to. He said he wanted the whole bizness, and we could go
ahead with the menagerie. Then I said to Pa that if he
had decided to go ahead, and not blame us for the consequences,
to repeat after me the following: ‘Bring forth the
Royal Bumper and let him Bump.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pa repeated the words, and my chum sprinkled the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>kyan pepper on the goat’s moustache, and he sneezed once
and looked sassy, and then he see the lager beer goat
rearing up, and he started for it just like a crow-catcher, and
blatted. Pa is real fat, but he knew he got hit, and he
grunted and said, ‘What you boys doin’?’ and then the
goat gave him another degree, and Pa pulled off the towel
and got up and started for the stairs, and so did the goat;
and Ma was at the bottom of the stairs listening, and
when I looked over the banisters Pa and Ma and the goat
were all in a heap, and Pa was yelling murder, and Ma was
screaming fire, and the goat was blatting, and sneezing,
and bunting, and the hired girl came into the hall and the
goat took after her, and she crossed herself just as the goat
struck her and said, ‘Howly mother, protect me!’ and went
down stairs the way we boys slide down hill, with both
hands on herself, and the goat reared up and blatted, and
Pa and Ma went into their room and shut the door, and
then my chum and me opened the front door and drove
the goat out. The minister, who comes to see Ma every
three times a week, was just ringing the bell, and the goat
thought he wanted to be nishiated too, and gave him one
for luck, and then went down the side walk, blatting, and
sneezing, and the minister came in the parlour and said he
was stabbed, and then Pa came out of his room with his
suspenders hanging down, and he didn’t know the minister
was there, and he said cuss words, and Ma cried and told
Pa he would go to the bad place sure, and Pa said he
didn’t care, he would kill that kussid goat afore he went,
and I told Pa the minister was in the parlour, and he and
Ma went down and said the weather was propitious for a
revival, and it seemed as though an outpouring of the
spirit was about to be vouchsafed, and none of them sot
down but Ma, cause the goat didn’t hit her, and while they
were talking relidgin with their mouths, and kussin’ the
goat inwardly, my chum and me adjourned the lodge, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>I went and stayed with him all night, and I haven’t been
home since. But I don’t believe Pa will lick me, ’cause he
said he would not hold us responsible for the consequences.
He ordered the goat hisself, and we filled the order, don’t
you see? Well, I guess I will go and sneak in the back
way, and find out from the hired girl how the land lays.
She won’t go back on me, ’cause the goat was not loaded
for hired girls. She just happened to get in at the wrong
time. Good-bye, sir. Remember and give your goat kyan
pepper in your lodge.”</p>

<p><span class='small'>THE BRITISH KNOCK</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='c026'><span class='sc'>London</span>, <i>October 30, 1802</i>.</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c025'>I HAVE lately made a most important discovery which
has disclosed one of the great secrets of English rank.
You, in the United States, knowing nothing of this, will
consider the following authentic history of rank a singular
curiosity.</p>
<p class='c009'>They have confined the several species of man within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>such definite limits, in this country, that the moment they
hear a knocking at the doors, they can tell you whether it
be a servant, a postman, a milkman, a half or whole gentleman,
a very great gentleman, a knight, or a nobleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>A servant is bound to lift the knocker once; should he
usurp a nobleman’s knock he would hazard his situation.
A postman knocks twice, very loudly. A milkman knocks
once, at the same time sending forth an artificial noise, not
unlike the yell of an American Indian. A mere gentleman
usually knocks three times, moderately; a terrible fellow
feels authorised to knock thrice, very loudly, generally
adding to these two or three faint knocks, which seem to
run into each other; but there is considerable art in doing
this elegantly, therefore it is not always attempted; but
it is a valuable accomplishment. A stranger who should
venture at an imitation would undoubtedly be taken for an
upstart. A knight presumes to give a <i>double knock</i>, that is
six raps, with a few faint ones at the end. I have not yet
ascertained the various peculiarities which distinguish the
degrees between the baronet and the nobleman; but this
I know too well, that a nobleman, at any time of night,
is allowed to knock so long and loud, that the whole
neighbourhood is frequently disturbed; and although fifty
people may be deprived of their night’s rest, there is no
redress at law or at equity. Nor have I learned how long
and loud a prince of the blood presumes to knock, though
doubtless he might knock an hour or two by way of
distinction.</p>

<p class='c009'>You may hold your sides if you please, but I assure you
I am perfectly serious. These people are so tenacious of
their prerogative, that a true-blooded Englishman goes near
to think it a part of British liberty. Indeed, I am convinced
I could place certain Englishmen in a situation, in
which, rather than knock at a door but once, they would
fight a duel every day in the week. Good heavens, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>would a fine gentleman appear if obliged to knock but
once at the door of a fashionable lady to whose party he
had been invited, while at the same moment a number of
his everyday friends, passing by, might observe the circumstance!
I cannot conceive of a more distressing occurrence.
The moment he entered the room the eyes of the
whole company would be turned on him; he would believe
himself disgraced for ever, he would feel himself annihilated,
for all his imaginary consequence, without which an Englishman
feels himself to be nothing, would have forsaken him.</p>

<p class='c009'>You may imagine it a very easy matter to pass from the
simple <i>rap</i> of the servant to that of the nobleman; but let
me inform you these little monosyllables stand in the place
of Alpine mountains, which neither vinegar nor valour can
pass. Hercules and Theseus, those vagabond but respectable
bullies, who govern by personal strength instead of a
standing army, would have hesitated an enterprise against
these raps. They have, by prescription, risen nearly to the
dignity of Common Law, of which strangers as well as
natives are bound to take notice. I was lately placed in a
pleasant position through ignorance of this. Soon after my
arrival I received an invitation to dine with a gentleman,
and in my economical way, with the greatest simplicity, I
gave one reasonable rap; after a considerable time a servant
opened the door and asked me <i>what I wanted</i>! I told him
Mr. ——. He replied “His <i>master</i> has company, but
will see if he can be spoken with.” In the meantime I
was left in the entry. Presently Mr. —— came, who, a
little mortified, began to reprove the servant; but it
appeared in the sequel he was perfectly right, for on telling
Mr. —— “<i>I knocked but once</i>,” he burst into a laugh, and
said he would explain that at dinner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should an honest fellow, ignorant of the consequences of
these raps, come to London in search of a place, and
unfortunately knock at a gentleman’s door, after the manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of noblemen, it might prejudice him as much as a prayer-book
once prejudiced a certain person in Connecticut. The
anecdote is this:—</p>

<p class='c009'>A young adventurer, educated Church-of-England-wise,
on going forth to seek his fortune, very naturally put his
prayer-book in his pocket. Wandering within the precincts
of Connecticut, he offered his service to a farmer, who, after
asking him a thousand questions (a New England custom),
gave him employment; but in the evening, the unlucky
prayer-book being discovered, he fairly turned the poor
wight out of doors to get a lodging where he could.</p>

<p class='c009'>You know the Connecticut <i>Blue Laws</i> made it death for
a priest, meaning a clergyman of the Church of England, to
be found within that State. Thank heaven, those days
are past. “God, liberty, and toleration,” whether a man
prefers a prayer-book to the missal, or the Koran to a
prayer-book, or a single rap at a door to the noise of a
dozen.</p>
<div class='c010'>Adieu.</div>
<p class='c022'>N.B.—You must keep this letter a profound secret, as we
have certain gentlemen on our side of the Atlantic who
would, in imitation of the noblemen here, disturb their
neighbours.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“WHILE PITMAN SEIZED THE SUFFERER BY ONE ARM, I GRASPED THE OTHER.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>IT is extremely probable that we shall lose our servant-girl.
She was the victim of a very singular catastrophe
a night or two since, in consequence of which she has
acquired a prejudice against the house of Adeler. We were
troubled with dampness in our cellar, and in order to
remove the difficulty we got a couple of men to come and
dig the earth out to the depth of twelve or fifteen inches, and
fill it in with a cement and mortar floor. The material was,
of course, very soft, and the workmen laid boards upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>surface, so that access to the furnace and the coal-bin was
possible. That night, just after retiring, we heard a woman
screaming for help; but after listening at the open window,
we concluded that Cooley and his wife were engaged in an
altercation, and so we paid no more attention to the noise.
Half-an-hour afterwards there was a violent ring at the front
door bell, and upon going to the window again I found
Pitman standing upon the door-step below. When I spoke
to him he said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Max,”—the judge is inclined sometimes, especially
during periods of excitement, to be unnecessarily familiar,—“there’s
somethin’ wrong in your cellar. There’s a woman
down there screechin’ and carryin’ on like mad. Sounds ’s
if somebody’s a-murderin’ her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I dressed and descended; and securing the assistance of
Pitman, so that I would be better prepared in the event of
burglars being discovered, I lighted a lamp and we went
into the cellar.</p>

<p class='c009'>There we found the maid-servant standing by the
refrigerator, knee-deep in the cement, and supporting herself
with the handle of a broom, which was also half-submerged.
In several places about her were air-holes
marking the spot where the milk-jug, the cold veal, the
Lima beans, and the silver-plated butter-dish had gone
down. We procured some additional boards, and while
Pitman seized the sufferer by one arm I grasped the other.
It was for some time doubtful if she would come to the
surface without the use of more violent means, and I
confess that I was half inclined to regard with satisfaction
the prospect that we would have to blast her loose with
gunpowder. After a desperate struggle, during which the
girl declared that she would be torn in pieces, Pitman and I
succeeded in getting her safely out, and she went upstairs
with half a barrel of cement on each leg, declaring that she
would leave the house in the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>The cold veal is in there yet. Centuries hence some
antiquarian will perhaps grub about the spot whereon my
cottage once stood, and will blow that cold veal out in a
petrified condition, and then present it to a museum as the
fossil remains of some unknown animal. Perhaps, too, he
will excavate the milk-jug and the butter-dish, and go about
lecturing upon them as utensils employed in bygone ages
by a race of savages called “The Adelers.” I should like
to be alive at the time to hear that lecture. And I cannot
avoid the thought that if our servant had been completely
buried in the cement, and thus carefully preserved until the
coming of that antiquarian, the lecture would be more
interesting, and the girl more useful than she is now. A
fossilised domestic servant of the present era would probably
astonish the people of the twenty-eighth century.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_65 c008'>“I TOOK my knitting-work and went up into the gallery,”
said Mrs. Partington, the day after visiting one of the
city courts; “I went up into the gallery, and, after I had
adjusted my specs, I looked down into the room, but I
couldn’t see any courting going on. An old gentleman
seemed to be asking a good many impertinent questions,—just
like some old folks,—and people were sitting around
making minuets of the conversation. I don’t see how they
made out what was said, for they all told different stories.
How much easier it would be to get along if they were all
made to tell the same story! What a sight of trouble it
would save the lawyers! The case, as they call it, was
given to the jury, but I couldn’t see it, and a gentleman
with a long pole was made to swear that he’d keep an eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>on ’em, and see that they didn’t run away with it. Bimeby
in they came agin, and then they said somebody was guilty
of something, who had just said he was innocent, and didn’t
know nothing about it no more than the little baby that
had never subsistence. I come away soon afterwards; but
I couldn’t help thinking how trying it must be to sit there
all day, shut out from the blessed air!”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>MISS CRUMP’S SONG.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>MISS CRUMP was inexorable. She declared that she
was entirely out of practice. “She scarcely ever
touched the piano;” “Mamma was always scolding her for
giving so much of her time to French and Italian, and
neglecting her music and painting; but she told mamma the
other day that it really was so irksome to her to quit Racine
and Dante, and go to thrumming upon the piano, that, but
for the obligations of filial obedience, she did not think she
should ever touch it again.”</p>
<p class='c009'>Here Mrs. Crump was kind enough, by the merest
accident in the world, to interpose, and to relieve the
company from farther anxiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Augusta, my dear,” said she, “go and play a tune or
two; the company will excuse your hoarseness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crump rose immediately at her mother’s bidding,
and moved to the piano, accompanied by a large group of
smiling faces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Poor child,” said Mrs. Crump, as she went forward,
“she is frightened to death. I wish Augusta could overcome
her diffidence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Crump was educated in Philadelphia; she had been
taught to sing by Madame Piggisqueaki, who was a pupil of
Ma’m’selle Crokifroggietta, who had sung with Madame
Catalani; and she had taken lessons on the piano from
Seignor Buzzifussi, who had played with Paganini.</p>

<p class='c009'>She seated herself at the piano, rocked to the right, then
to the left, leaned forward, then backward, and began. She
placed her right hand about midway the keys, and her left
about two octaves below it. She now put off to the right
in a brisk canter up the treble notes, and the left after it.
The left then led the way back, and the right pursued it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>like manner. The right turned, and repeated its first movement;
but the left outran it this time, hopped over it, and
flung it entirely off the track. It came in again, however,
behind the left on its return, and passed it in the same style.
They now became highly incensed at each other, and met
furiously on the middle ground. Here a most awful conflict
ensued for about the space of ten seconds, when the
right whipped off all of a sudden, as I thought, fairly
vanquished. But I was in the error against which Jack
Randolph cautions us; “it had only fallen back to a
stronger position.” It mounted upon two black keys, and
commenced the note of a rattlesnake. This had a wonderful
effect upon the left, and placed the doctrine of “snake
charming” beyond dispute. The left rushed furiously
towards it repeatedly, but seemed invariably panic-struck
when it came within six keys of it, and as invariably retired
with a tremendous roaring down the bass keys.</p>

<p class='c009'>It continued its assaults, sometimes by the way of the
naturals, sometimes by the way of the sharps, and sometimes
by a zigzag through both; but all its attempts to dislodge
the right from its stronghold proving ineffectual, it
came close up to its adversary, and expired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Any one, or rather no one, can imagine what kind of
noises the piano gave forth during the conflict. Certain it
is, no one can describe them, and, therefore, I shall not
attempt it. The battle ended, Miss Augusta moved as
though she would have arisen, but this was protested against
by a number of voices at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One song, my dear Aurelia,” said Miss Small; “you
must sing that sweet little French air you used to sing in
Philadelphia, and which Madame Piggisqueaki was so fond
of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Augusta looked pitifully at her mamma, and her
mamma looked “sing” at Miss Augusta; accordingly, she
squared herself for a song.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“SOME VERY CURIOUS SOUNDS, WHICH APPEARED TO PROCEED FROM<br />THE LIPS OF MISS AUGUSTA.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>She brought her hands to the campus this time in fine
style, and they seemed now to be perfectly reconciled to
each other. They commenced a kind of colloquy; the
right whispering treble very softly, and the left responding
bass very loudly. The conference had been kept up until
I began to desire a change of the subject, when my ear
caught, indistinctly, some very curious sounds, which
appeared to proceed from the lips of Miss Augusta; they
seemed to be compounded of a dry cough, a grunt, a
hiccough, and a whisper; and they were introduced, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>appeared to me, as interpreters between the right and the
left.</p>

<p class='c009'>Things progressed in this way for about the space of
fifteen seconds, when I happened to direct my attention to
Mr. Jenkins, from Philadelphia. His eyes were closed, his
head rolled gracefully from side to side; a beam of heavenly
complacency rested upon his countenance; and his whole
man gave irresistible demonstration that Miss Crump’s music
made him feel good all over. I had just turned from the
contemplation of Mr. Jenkins’ transports, to see whether I
could extract from the performance anything intelligible,
when Miss Crump made a fly-catching grab at half-a-dozen
keys in a row and at the same instant she fetched a long,
dunghill-cock crow, at the conclusion of which she grabbed
as many keys with her left. This came over Jenkins like a
warm bath, and over me like a rake of bamboo briers.</p>

<p class='c009'>My nerves had not recovered from this shock before Miss
Augusta repeated the movement, and accompanied it with
a squall of a pinched cat. This threw me into an ague
fit; but, from respect to the performer, I maintained my
position.</p>

<p class='c009'>She now made a third grasp with the right, boxed the
faces of six keys in a row with the left, and at the same
time raised one of the most unearthly howls that ever
issued from the throat of a human being. This seemed
the signal for universal uproar and destruction. She now
threw away all her reserve, and charged the piano with her
whole force. She boxed it, she clawed it, she raked it, she
scraped it. Her neck-vein swelled, her chin flew up, her
face flushed, her eye glared, her bosom heaved; she
screamed, she howled, she yelled, cackled, and was in the
act of dwelling upon the note of a screech-owl, when I
took the St. Vitus’s dance, and rushed out of the room.
“Good Lord,” said a bystander, “if this be her <i>singing</i>,
what must her <i>crying be</i>!” As I reached the door I heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>a voice exclaim, “By heavens! she’s the most enchanting
performer I ever heard in my life!” I turned to see who
was the author of this ill-timed compliment, and who should
it be but Nick Truck, from Lincoln, who seven years before
was dancing “Possum up the Gumtree” in the chimney-corner
of his father’s kitchen. Nick had entered the counting-room
of a merchant in Charleston some five or six years
before, had been sent out as supercargo of a vessel to
Bordeaux, and while the vessel was delivering one cargo
and taking in another, had contracted a wonderful relish
for French music.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for myself, I went home in convulsions; took sixty
drops of laudanum, and fell asleep. I dreamed that I was
in a beautiful city, the streets of which intersected each
other at right angles; that the birds of the air and the
beasts of the forest had gathered there for battle, the
former led on by a Frenchman, the latter by an Italian;
that I was looking on their movements towards each other,
when I heard the cry of “Hecate is coming!” I turned
my eye to the north-east, and saw a female flying through
the air toward the city, and distinctly recognised in her the
features of Miss Crump. I took the alarm, and was making
my escape, when she gave command for the beasts and
birds to fall on me. They did so, and, with all the noises
of the animal world, were in the act of tearing me to pieces,
when I was waked by the stepping of Hall, my room-mate,
into bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, my dear sir,” exclaimed I, “you have waked me
from a horrible dream. What o’clock is it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ten minutes after twelve,” said he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where have you been to this late hour?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have just returned from the party.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what kept you so late?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I disliked to retire while Miss Crump was playing.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“In mercy’s name!” said I, “is she playing yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said he; “I had to leave her playing at last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where was Jenkins?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was there, still in ecstasies, and urging her to play
on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And where was Truck?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He was asleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what was she playing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An Italian——”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here I swooned, and heard no more.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>A POLYGLOT BARBER.</i></h2>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib238.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>MY first tonsorial experience is in a barber shop of the
old town of Prinkipo. Most of the barbers are
polyglotically inclined. My particular barber is either a
Greek, a Maltese, a Sclav, a Bulgarian, or a Montenegrin.
It is impossible at first to tell his native tongue. He has
French glibly. He speaks a “leetle Inglis,” and understands
less. He is well up in Italian, as many of the
families in this vicinage are. He had some knowledge of
Spanish, as kindred to the Italian. This extraordinary
learning always gives me a shudder, and especially when
under his razor or shears. Being a stranger on the island,
and having no very pronounced national features, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>equally difficult for him to ascertain my nationality, except
by inquisition long and pitiless. All I could do was to
arm myself with the affirmatives and negatives of various
languages. With these I made myself complaisant, to save
my face from bloodshed. My first conversation with this
artist confirmed the general reputation as to the gossipy
quality of the Barber of Seville. He had all the gossip of
the isles, including its languages. The conversation ran
somewhat after this style—</p>
<p class='c009'>Barber: “You have been here long?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I reply in Bohemian, “<i>Ne!</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>He easily understood that.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are here for your health?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I reply in Danish, affirmatively and negatively, “<i>Ja!</i>”
“<i>Nei, minherre!</i>” “Yes, sir,” and “No, sir.” This
puzzled him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An army gentleman, perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I reply in German, “<i>Nein, mein herr</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, then you are a navy officer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having in view my position as admiral of the launch, I
reply in Hungarian; because, <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>, Hungary
is an inland country, and, like our own, without a navy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Igen!</i>” “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your vessel is at Constantinople?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Remembering that there was an Italian emigrant named
Christopher Columbus of naval renown, I reply: “<i>Si, signore</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will bring your vessel to Prinkipo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah! here was my opportunity. It is the modern Greek
in which I reply: “<i>Nae vevayos</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He is thunderstruck. It is evidently his mother-tongue.
Likely he has a Polish father; who knows? When he
asks me in French—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will your vessel touch at Athens?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I respond in Polish, “<i>Tak!</i>” “No.” And then, with some
hesitation, I add the French word, “<i>peut-être</i>.” “Perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“You will visit Egypt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Sim, senhor.</i>” This is Portuguese for “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The gesture or the manner with which these responses
are made encourages him, for he immediately asks whether
I have ever been in Alabania. I have no negative or
affirmative in any of the languages of the Adriatic. My
Dalmatian servitor, Pedro, is absent, and my next best
affirmative is in Russian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Do prawda.</i>” Perhaps, being affiliated with the Sclav,
he understands this language.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have never been in Egypt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the pine and the palm are associated in my mind,
and having connected the Polar midnight sun with the
Pyramids of the Pharaohs, I respond in Swedish, making it
intense—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Ja!</i>” adding a little affirmative in Roumanian, to give
intensity to the remark, “<i>Gie</i>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After a pause in the conversation he resumes. He
believes that he has my nationality fixed. He surmises
that I am from some Balkan province, and he asks—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you been in Roumelia, Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro,
and Herzegovina?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Knowing that I could not answer this truthfully, and
not being able to answer it partially, I give him back in
Roumanian an emphatic negative—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Na canna, bucca.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have been quite a traveller!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This suggests the Chinese as the fitting language for the
affirmative, and I say—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>She!</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having no reference to Haggard’s novel, for it was not
then out. To make the “<i>she</i>” expressive I add another
affirmative, which I had carefully studied while boarding
with the Chinese Legation in Washington.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Ta Jin!</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“You like the Chinese, Monsieur?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having succeeded so well with the Chinese, I answer
promptly in the negative—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Puh!</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>This monosyllable disgusts him. His subordinates
gather around the chair where I was being shaved,
interested in this composite conversation. The artist then
asks if I had visited Jerusalem. Here was my great
breakdown. Notwithstanding I had represented a Hebrew
community in New York, with more synagogues than
Jerusalem had in the time of Solomon, I was at a loss for a
Hebrew affirmative. Happy thought! I respond promptly
in the Arabic tongue, with its guttural peculiarity—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Na’am.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>It sounded to me after I uttered it like profanity, and I
fell back as gracefully as I could, waiting for the next
attack, and equipped with a Japanese expletive.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You like Constantinople?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I respond in a sweet Japanese accent—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Sama, san!</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How long have you been in Constantinople?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I give it to him in English—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I arrived there in the year 1851—thirty-six years ago.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Mon Dieu!—mon Dieu!—mon Dieu!</i>” he exclaims,
“Have you lived there ever since that time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Beaucoup, Monsieur!</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>He has not yet learned my nationality. I am afraid
every moment that he will strike America. It comes—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps you have been in America?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wa’al, yaas, I guess!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He could not understand this, for he had not been educated
at Robert College, nor had he abided in Vermont.
I ask him in French which America he means. He says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“South America. I have a cousin of my wife’s there,
and I would like to know how the country looks.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“<i>Le nom du cousin de votre femme?</i>” I ask.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pierre Moulka Pari Michipopouli. He is like you,
Monsieur—quite a traveller.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then began a fusillade of questions and rattling replies.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have lived in Paris, Monsieur?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Jamais!</i>” “Never.” “Been to Genoa?” “<i>Si,
Signore.</i>” “Ah, you are English, are you not?” With the
intense Turkish negative I respond, “<i>Yok!</i>” “French?”
“<i>Non.</i>” “German?” “<i>Nein.</i>” “Sclav?” “<i>Nee.</i>” “Italian?”
“<i>No, Signore.</i>” “Ah! Espagnol? You look like one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon, Monsieur, I am not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said he, taking breath, “will you tell me,
Monsieur, where you do come from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you remember the only nation in the world
where the barber is as good as a king?” I said proudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Switzerland. <i>Sapristi! Corpo de Bacco!</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>Understanding that last remark perfectly, I offer him a
cigarette, and say, “No, I am not Swiss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brazeel?” “<i>Jamais.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The way that barber rubs the unguent into my hairless
scalp and hirsute beard shows that he is a disappointed
man.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next time I visit the shop I receive marked attention.
The hands all rise up. They pick up the earth in
a Turkish <i>salaam</i>. They distribute it in courtesy to the
American minister, whom they have meanwhile discovered.
As I have been frequently turned away from the doors of
our American Congress after twenty-five years’ service,
because I did not act or look like a member, so I was
unrecognised here, by the “<i>Oi Barberoi</i>,” as having no
national characterisation. America was the last race or
people to which this Greek barber assigned me.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>OUR NEW BEDSTEAD.</i></h2>
</div>
<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib253.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“WE HAD TO TURN OUT EVERY HOUR.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I HAVE bought me a new patent bedstead, to facilitate
early rising, called a “wake-up.” It is a good thing to
rise early in the country. Even in the winter time it is
conducive to health to get out of a warm bed by lamplight;
to shiver into your drawers and slippers; to wash your face
in a basin of ice-flakes; and to comb out your frigid hair
with an uncompromising comb, before a frosty looking-glass.
The only difficulty about it lies in the impotence of
human will. You will deliberate about it and argue the
point. You will indulge in specious pretences, and lie still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>with only the tip end of your nose outside the blankets;
you will pretend to yourself that you <i>do</i> intend to jump out
in a few minutes; you will tamper with the good intention,
and yet indulge in the delicious luxury. To all this the
“wake-up” is inflexibly and triumphantly antagonistic.
It is a bedstead with a clock scientifically inserted in the
head-board. When you go to bed you wind up the clock,
and point the index-hand to that hour on the dial at which
you wish to rise in the morning. Then you place yourself
in the hands of the invention and shut your eyes.</p>
<p class='c009'>You are now, as it were, under the guardianship of King
Solomon and Doctor Benjamin Franklin. There is no
need to recall those beautiful lines of the poet’s—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Early to bed and early to rise,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Will make a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Science has forestalled them. The “wake-up” is a combination
of hard wood, hinges, springs, and clock-work,
against sleeping late o’ mornings. It is a bedstead with
all the beautiful vitality of a flower—it opens with the
dawn. If, for instance, you set the hand against six o’clock
in the morning, at six the clock at the bed’s head solemnly
strikes a demi-twelve on its sonorous bell. If you pay no
attention to the monitor, or idly, dreamily endeavour to
compass the coherent sequence of sounds, the invention,
within the succeeding two minutes, drops its tail-board and
lets down your feet upon the floor. While you are pleasantly
defeating this attempt upon your privacy by drawing up
your legs within the precincts of the blankets, the virtuous
head-board and the rest of the bed suddenly rise up in
protest; and the next moment, if you do not instantly
abdicate, you are launched upon the floor by a blind elbow
that connects with the crank of an eccentric, that is turned
by a cord that is wound around a drum, that is moved by
an endless screw, that revolves within the body of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>machinery. So soon as you are turned out, of course, you
waive the balance of the nap and proceed to dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mrs. Sparrowgrass,” said I, contemplatively, after the
grimy machinists had departed, “this machine is one of
the most remarkable evidences of progress the ingenuity of
man has yet developed. In this bedstead we see a host of
cardinal virtues made practical by science. To rise early
one must possess courage, prudence, self-denial, temperance,
and fortitude. The cultivation of these virtues, necessarily
attended with a great deal of trouble, may now be dispensed
with, as this engine can entirely set aside, and render useless,
a vast amount of moral discipline. I have no doubt
in a short time we shall see the finest attributes of the
human mind superseded by machinery. Nay, more; I
have very little doubt that, as a preparatory step in this
great progress, we shall have physical monitors of cast-iron
and wheel-work to regulate the ordinary routine of duty in
every family.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Sparrowgrass said she did not precisely understand
what I meant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For instance,” said I, in continuation, “we dine every
day; as a general thing, I mean. Now sometimes we eat
too much, and how easy, how practicable it would be to
regulate our appetites by a banquet-dial. The subject,
having had the superficial area of his skull and the cubic
capacity of his body worked out respectively by a licensed
craniologist and by a licensed corporalogist, gets from each
a certificate, which certificates are duly registered in the
county clerk’s office. From the county clerk he received
a permit, marked, we will say, ten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not ten pounds, I hope,” said Mrs. S.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear,” I replied, “ten would be the average
of his capacity. We will now suppose the chair, in which
the subject is seated at dinner, rests upon a pendulous
platform, over a delicate arrangement of levers, connected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>with an upright rod, that runs through the section of table
in front of his plate, and this rod, we will suppose, is
toothed into a ratchet-wheel, that moves the index of the
banquet-dial. You will see at once that, as he hangs
balanced in this scale, any absorption of food would be
instantly indicated by the index. All then he is called
upon to do is to watch the dial until the hand points to
‘ten,’ and then stop eating.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” said Mrs. Sparrowgrass, “suppose he shouldn’t be
half through?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said I, “that would not make any difference.
When the dial says he has had enough, he must quit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” said Mrs. Sparrowgrass, “suppose he <i>would not</i>
stop eating?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then,” said I, “the proper way to do would be to
inform against him, and have him brought immediately
before a justice of the peace, and if he did not at once
swear that he had eaten within his limits, fine him, and
seize all the victuals on his premises.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said Mrs. S., “you would have a law to regulate
it, then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course,” said I, “a statute—a statutory provision,
or provisionary act. Then, the principle once being
established, you see how easily and beautifully we could
be regulated by the simplest motive powers. All the
obligations we now owe to society and to ourselves could
be dispensed with, or rather transferred to, or vested in,
some superior machine, to which we would be accountable
by night and day. Nay, more than that, instead of sending
representatives to legislate for us, how easy it would be
to construct a legislature of bronze and wheel-work—an
incorruptible legislature. I would suggest a hydraulic or
pneumatic congress as being less liable to explode, and
more easily graduated than one propelled by steam simply.
All that would be required of us then would be to elect a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>state engineer annually, and he, with the assistance of a few
underlings, could manage the automata as he pleased.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not see,” replied Mrs. Sparrowgrass, “how that
would be an improvement upon the present method, from
all I hear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This unexpected remark of Mrs. S. surprised me into
silence for a moment, but immediately recovering, I
answered, that a hydraulic or pneumatic legislature would
at least have this advantage—it would construct enactments
for the State at, at least, one-fiftieth part of the present
expense, and at the same time do the work better and
quicker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear,” said I, as I wound up the ponderous
machinery with a huge key, “as you are always an early
riser, and as, of course, you will be up before seven o’clock,
I will set the indicator at that hour, so that you will not be
disturbed by the progress of science. It is getting to be
very cold, my dear, but how beautiful the stars are to-night.
Look at Orion and the Pleiades! Intensely lustrous in the
frosty sky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The sensations one experiences in lying down upon a
complication of mechanical forces are somewhat peculiar
if they are not entirely novel. I once had the pleasure, for
one week, of sleeping over the boiler of a high-pressure
Mississippi steamboat; and, as I knew in case of a blow up
I should be the first to hear of it, I composed my mind as
well as I could under the circumstances. But this reposing
upon a bed of statics and dynamics, with the constant
chirping and crawling of wheel-work at the bed’s head,
with a thought now and then of the inexorable iron elbow
below, and an uncertainty as to whether the clock itself
might not be too fast, or too slow, caused me to be rather
reflective and watchful than composed and drowsy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, I enjoyed the lucent stars in their blue
depths, and the midnight moon, now tipping the Palisades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>with a fringe of silver fire, and was thinking how many
centuries that lovely light had played upon those rugged
ridges of trap and basalt, and so finally sinking from the
reflective to the imaginative, and from the imaginative to
the indistinct, at last reached that happy state of half
consciousness, between half asleep and asleep, when the
clock in the machine woke up, and suddenly struck eight.
Of course I knew it was later, but I could not imagine why
it should at all, as I presumed the only time of striking was
in the morning by way of signal. As Mrs. S. was sound
asleep, I concluded not to say anything to her about it;
but I could not help thinking what an annoyance it would
be if the clock should keep on striking the hours during the
night. In a little while the bedclothes seemed to droop at
the foot of the bed, to which I did not pay much attention,
as I was just then engaged listening to the drum below,
that seemed to be steadily engaged in winding up its rope
and preparing for action. Then I felt the upper part of
the patent bedstead rising up, and then I concluded to
jump out, just as the iron elbow began to utter a cry like
unto the cry of a steel Katydid, and did jump, but was
accidentally preceded by the mattress, one bolster, two
pillows, ditto blankets, a brace of threadbare linen sheets,
one coverlid, the baby, one cradle (overturned), and Mrs.
Sparrowgrass. To gather up these heterogeneous materials
of comfort required some little time, and, in the meanwhile,
the bedstead subsided. When we retired again, and were
once more safely protected from the nipping cold, although
pretty well cooled, I could not help speaking of the perfect
operation of the bedstead in high terms of praise, although,
by some accident, it had fulfilled its object a little earlier
than had been desirable. As I am very fond of dilating
upon a pleasant theme, the conversation was prolonged
until Mrs. Sparrowgrass got sleepy, and the clock struck
nine. Then we had to turn out again. We had to turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>out every hour during the long watches of the night for that
wonderful epitome of the age of progress.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the morning came we were sleepy enough, and the
next evening we concluded to replace the “wake-up” with
a common, old-fashioned bedstead. To be sure I had
made a small mistake the first night, in not setting the
“<i>indicator</i>” as well as the <i>index</i> of the dial. But what of
that? Who wants his rest, that precious boon, subjected to
contingencies? When we go to sleep, and say our prayers,
let us wake up according to our natures, and according to
our virtues; some require more sleep, some less; we are
not mere bits of mechanism after all; who knows what
world we may chance to wake up in? For my part, I have
determined not to be a humming-top, to be wound up and
to run down, just like that very interesting toy one of the
young Sparrowgrassii has just now left upon my table, minus
a string.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>A QUILTING.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I MUST tell you, however, of a quilting which I did not
share with Mr. Sibthorpe, though I wished for him
many times during the afternoon. It was held at the house
of a very tidy neighbour, a Mrs. Boardman, the neatness of
whose dwelling and its outworks I have often admired in
passing. She invited all the neighbours, and, of course,
included my unworthy self, although I had never had any
other acquaintance than that which may be supposed to result
from John and Sophy’s having boarded with her for some
time. The walking being damp, an ox cart was sent round for
such of the guests as had no “team” of their own, which is
our case as yet. This equipage was packed with hay, over
which was disposed, by way of <i>musnud</i>, a blue and white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>coverlet; and by this arrangement half-a-dozen goodly
dames, including myself, found reclining room, and were
carried at a stately pace to Mrs. Boardman’s. Here we
found a collection of women busily occupied in preparing
the quilt, which you may be sure was a curiosity to me.
They had stretched the lining on a frame, and were now
laying fleecy cotton on it with much care; and I understood
from several aside remarks, which were not intended for the
ear of our hostess, that a due regard for etiquette required
that this laying of the cotton should have been performed
before the arrival of the company, in order to give them a
better chance for finishing the quilt before tea, which is
considered a point of honour.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id036'>
<img src='images/ib260.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“CARRIED AT A STATELY PACE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c009'>However, with so many able hands at work, the preparations
were soon accomplished. The “bats” were smoothly
disposed, and now consenting hands on either side</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c012'>
    <div>Induced a splendid cover, green and blue,</div>
    <div>Yellow and red,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>wherein stars and garters, squares and triangles, figured in
every possible relation to each other, and produced, on the
whole, a very pretty mathematical piece of work, on which
the eyes of Mrs. Boardman rested with no small amount of
womanly pride.</p>
<p class='c009'>Now needles were in requisition, and every available
space round the frame was filled by a busy dame.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several of the company, being left-handed, or rather,
ambidextrous (no unusual circumstance here), this peculiarity
was made serviceable at the corners, where common seamstresses
could only sew in one direction, while these
favoured individuals could turn their double power to
double account. This beginning of the solid labour was
a serious time. Scarcely a word was spoken beyond an
occasional request for the thread, or an exclamation at the
snapping of a needle. This last seemed of no unfrequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>occurrence, as you may well suppose, when you think of
the thickness of the materials, and the necessity for making
at least tolerably short stitches. I must own that the most
I could accomplish for the first hour was the breaking of
needles, and the pricking of my fingers in the vain attempt
to do as I was bid, and take my stitches “clear through.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By-and-by it was announced that it was time to roll—and
all was bustle and anxiety. The frame had to be taken
apart at the corners, and two of the sides rolled several
times with much care, and at this diminished surface we
began again with renewed spirit. Now all tongues seemed
loosened. The evidence of progress had raised everybody’s
spirits, and the strife seemed to be who should talk fastest
without slackening the industry of her fingers. Some held
<i>tête-à-tête</i> communications with a crony in an undertone;
others discussed matters of general interest more openly;
and some made observations at nobody in particular, but
with a view to the amusement of all. Mrs. Vining told the
symptoms of each of her five children through an attack of
the measles; Mrs. Keteltas gave her opinion as to the party
most worthy of blame in a late separation in the village;
and Miss Polly Mittles said she hoped the quilt would not
be “scant of stitches, like a bachelor’s shirt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tea-time came before the work was completed, and some
of the more generous declared they would rather finish it
before tea. These offers fell rather coldly, however, for
a real tea-drinker does not feel very good-humoured just
before tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Mr. Boardman drove four stout nails in the rafters
overhead, corresponding in distance with the corners of the
quilt, and the frame was raised and fastened to these, so as
to be undisturbed, and yet out of the way during the
important ceremony that was to succeed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is it not well said that “Necessity is the mother of
invention”?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>A long table was now spread, eked out by boards laid
upon carpenters’ “horses,” and this was covered with a
variety of table-cloths, all shining clean, however, and carefully
disposed. The whole table array was equally various,
the contributions, I presume, of several neighbouring log-houses.
The feast spread upon it included every variety that
ever was put upon a tea-table; from cake and preserves to
pickles and raw cabbage cut up in vinegar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Pies there were, and custards and sliced ham, and cheese,
and three or four kinds of bread. I could do little besides
look, and try to guess out the dishes. However, everything
was very good, and our hostess must have felt complimented
by the attention paid to her various delicacies.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cabbage, I think, was rather the favourite; vinegar
being one of the rarities of a settler’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was amused to see the loads of cake and pie that
accumulated upon the plates of the guests.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all had finished, most of the plates seemed full.
But I was told afterwards that it was not considered civil to
decline any one kind of food, though your hostess may have
provided a dozen. You are expected at least to try each
variety. But this leads to something which I cannot think
very agreeable.</p>

<p class='c009'>After all had left the table, our hostess began to clear it
away, that the quilt might be restored to its place; and, as
a preliminary, she went all round to the different plates,
selecting such pieces of cake as were but little <i>bitten</i>, and
paring off the half-demolished edges with a knife, in order
to replace them in their original circular position in the
dishes. When this was accomplished, she assiduously
scraped from the edges of the plates the scraps of butter
that had escaped demolition, and wiped them back on the
remains of the pat. This was doubtless a season of delectation
to the economical soul of Mrs. Boardman; you may
imagine its effects upon the nerves of your friend. Such is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the influence of habit! The good woman doubtless thought
she was performing a praiseworthy action, and one in no
wise at variance with her usual neat habits; and if she
could have peeped into my heart, and there have read the
resolutions I was tacitly making against breaking bread
again under the same auspices, she would have pitied or
despised such a lamentable degree of pride and extravagance.
So goes this strange world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The quilt was replaced, and several good housewives
seated themselves at it, determined to “see it out.” I was
reluctantly compelled to excuse myself, my inexperienced
fingers being pricked to absolute rawness. But I have
since ascertained that the quilt was finished that evening,
and placed on Mrs. Boardman’s best bed immediately; where
indeed I see it every time I pass the door, as it is not our
custom to keep our handsome things in the background.
There were some long stitches in it, I know, but they do
not show as far as the road; so the quilt is a very great
treasure, and will probably be kept as an heirloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have some thoughts of an attempt in the “patchwork”
line myself. One of the company at Mrs. Boardman’s
remarked that the skirt of the French cambric dress I
wore would make a “splendid” quilt. It is a temptation,
certainly.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib265.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>THE town of Sussex, Pennsylvania, has lately been profoundly
stirred by an extraordinary and romantic lawsuit.
The case was an entirely novel one, and no precedent
bearing upon it is to be found in the common or statute
law. While it is necessarily a matter of great interest to
the legal profession, its romantic side cannot fail to attract
the attention of persons of all ages and every kind of sex.
In fact, it is destined to be one of the most celebrated cases
in the annals of American jurisprudence.</p>
<p class='c009'>Some time last winter a lady whom we will call Mrs.
Smith, who kept a boarding-house in Sussex, took her little
girl, aged four, with her to make a call on Mrs. Brown, her
near neighbour. Mrs. Brown was busy in the kitchen,
where she received her visitor with her usual cordiality.
There was a large fire blazing in the stove, and while the
ladies were excitedly discussing the new bonnet of the local
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Methodist minister’s wife, the little girl incautiously sat
down on the stove hearth. She was instantly convinced
that the hearth was exceedingly hot, and on loudly bewailing
the fact, was rescued by her mother and carried home
for medical treatment. A few days later Mrs. Smith burst
in great excitement into the room of a young law student,
who was one of her boarders, and with tears and lamentations
disclosed to him the fact that her child was indelibly
branded with the legend, “Patented, 1872.” These words
in raised letters had happened to occupy just that part of
the stove-hearth on which the child had seated herself, and
being heated nearly to red heat they had reproduced themselves
on the surface of the unfortunate child.</p>

<p class='c009'>The law student entered into the mother’s sorrow with
much sympathy, but after he had in some degree calmed
her mind he informed her that a breach of law had been
committed. “Your child,” he remarked, “has never been
patented, but she is marked ‘Patented, 1872.’ This is
an infringement of the statute. You falsely represent by
that brand that a child for whom no patent was issued is
patented. This false representation is forgery, and subjects
you to penalty made and provided for that crime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Smith was, as may be supposed, greatly alarmed at
learning this statement, and her first impulse was to beg the
young man to save her from a convict’s cell. With a
gravity suited to the occasion, he explained the whole law
of patents. He told her that had she desired to patent the
child, she should have either constructed a model of it or
prepared accurate drawings, with specifications showing distinctly
what parts of the child she claimed to have invented.
This model or these drawings she should have forwarded to
the Patent Office, and she would then have received in
due time a patent—provided, of course, the child was really
patentable—and would have been authorised to label it
“Patented.” “Unfortunately,” he pursued, “it is now too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>late to take this course, and we must boldly claim that a
patent was issued, but that the record was destroyed during
the recent fire in the Patent Office.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This suggestion cheered the spirits of Mrs. Smith, but
they were again dashed by the further remarks of the young
man. He reminded her that the child might find it very
inconvenient to be patented. “If we claim,” he went on to
say, “that she has been regularly patented, it follows that
the ownership of the patent, including the child herself,
belongs to you, and will pass at your death into the
possession of your heirs. Holding the patent, they can
prevent any husband taking possession of the girl by
marriage, and they can sell, assign, transfer, and set over
the patent right and the accompanying girl to any purchaser.
If she is sold to a speculator or to a joint-stock
company, she will find her position a most unpleasant one;
and to sum up the case, madam, either your child is
patented or she is not. If she is not patented, you are
guilty of forgery. If she is patented, she is an object of
barter and sale, or in other words a chattel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was certainly a wretched state of things, and Mrs.
Smith, to ease her mind, began to abuse Mrs. Brown, whose
stove had branded the unfortunate little girl. She loudly
insisted that the whole fault rested with Mrs. Brown, and
demanded to know if the latter could not be punished.
The young man, who was immensely learned in the law,
thereupon began a new argument. He told her that where
there is a wrong there must, in the nature of things, be a
remedy. “Mrs. Brown, by means of her stove, has done
you a great wrong. In accordance with the maxim, <i>Qui
facit per alium facit per se</i>, Mrs. Brown, and not the stove, is
the party from whom you must demand redress. She has
wickedly and maliciously, and at the instigation of the
devil, branded your child, and thus rendered you liable for
an infringement of the patent law. It is my opinion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>madam, that an action for assault and an action for libel will
both lie against Mrs. Brown, and ‘<i>semble</i>’ that there is also
ground for having her indicted for procurement of forgery.”
Finally, after much further argument, the young man
advised her to apply to a magistrate and procure the arrest
and punishment of Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly, Mrs. Smith applied to the Mayor, who, after
vainly trying to comprehend the case, and to find out what
was the precise crime alleged against Mrs. Brown, compromised
the matter by unofficially asking the lady to
appear before him. When both the ladies were in court
Mrs. Smith, prompted by the clerk, put her complaint in
the shape of a charge that Mrs. Brown had branded the
youthful Smith girl. The latter was then marked “Exhibit
A,” and formally put in evidence, and both complainant and
defendant told their respective stories.</p>

<p class='c009'>The result was that the court, in a very able and
voluminous opinion, decided that nobody was guilty of
anything, but that, with a view of avoiding the penalty
of infringing the patent law, the mother must apply to
Congress for a special act declaring the child regularly and
legally patented.</p>

<p class='c009'>If Congress finds time to attend to this important matter,
little Miss Smith will be the first girl ever patented in this
country, and the legal profession will watch with unflagging
interest the law-suits to which in future any infringement of
the patent may lead.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>“SIR,” said our learned friend, Dr. Bushwhacker, “we
are indebted to China for the four principal blessings
we enjoy. Tea came from China, the compass came
from China, printing came from China, and gunpowder
came from China—thank God! China, sir, is an old
country, a very old country. There is one word, sir, we
got from China that is oftener in the mouths of American
people than any other word in the language. It is
<i>cash</i>, sir, cash! That we derive from the Chinese. It
is the name, sir, of the small brass coin they use, the
coin with a square hole in the middle. And then look at
our Franklin; he drew the lightning from the skies with his
kite; but who invented the kite, sir? The long-tailed
Chinaman, sir. Franklin had no invention; he never
would have invented a kite or a printing-press. But he
could use them, sir, to the best possible advantage, sir; he
had no genius, sir, but he had remarkable talent and
industry.</p>
<p class='c009'>“Then, sir, we got our umbrella from China. The first
man that carried an umbrella, in London, in Queen Anne’s
reign, was followed by a mob. That is only one hundred
and fifty years ago. We get the art of making porcelain
from China. Our ladies must thank the Celestials for their
tea-pots.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Queen Elizabeth never saw a tea-pot in her life. In
1664 the East India Company brought two pounds two
ounces of tea as a present for his Majesty King Charles
the Second. In 1667 they imported one hundred pounds
of tea.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, sir, rose the reign of scandal. Queen scandal, sir!
Then, sir, rose the intolerable race of waspish spinsters who
sting reputations and defame humanity over their dyspeptic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>cups. Then, sir, the astringent principle of the herb was
communicated to the heart, and domestic troubles were
brewed and fomented over the tea-table. Then, sir, the age
of chivalry was over, and women grew acrid and bitter;
then, sir, the first temperance society was founded, and
high duties were laid upon wines, and in consequence they
distilled whisky instead, which made matters a great deal
better, of course; and all the abominations, all the difficulties
of domestic life, all the curses of living in a country
village; the intolerant canvassing of character, reputation,
piety; the nasty, mean, prying spirit; the uncharitable,
defamatory, gossiping, tale-bearing, whispering, unwomanly,
unchristianlike behaviour of those who set themselves up
for patterns over their vile decoctions, sir, arose with the
introduction of tea. Yes, sir; when the wine-cup gave
place to the tea-cup, then the devil, sir, reached his culminating
point.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The curiosity of Eve was bad enough; but, sir, when
Eve’s curiosity becomes sharpened by turgid tonics, and
scandal is added to inquisitiveness, and innuendo supplies
the place of truth, and an imperfect digestion is the pilot
instead of charity; then, sir, we must expect to see human
nature vilified, and levity condemned, and good fellowship
condemned, and all good men, from Washington down,
damned by Miss Tittle, and Miss Tattle, and the widow
Blackleg, and the whole host of tea-drinking conspirators
against social enjoyment.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Here Dr. Bushwhacker grew purple with eloquence and
indignation. We ventured to remark that he had spoken
of tea “as a blessing” at first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sir,” responded Dr. Bushwhacker, shaking his
bushy head, “that reminds one of Doctor Pangloss. Yes,
sir, it is a blessing, but like all other blessings it must be
used <i>temperately</i>, or else it is a curse! China, sir,” continued
the doctor, dropping the oratorical and taking up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>the historical; “China, sir, knows nothing of perspective,
but she is great in pigments. Indian ink, sir, is Chinese, so
are vermilion and indigo; the malleable properties of gold,
sir, were first discovered by this extraordinary people; we
must thank them for our gold leaf. Gold is not a pigment,
but roast pig is, and Charles Lamb says the origin of roast
pig is Chinese; the beautiful fabric we call silk, sir, came
from the Flowery Nation, so did embroidery, so did the
game of chess, so did fans. In fact, sir, it is difficult to
say what we have not derived from the Chinese. Cotton,
sir, is our great staple, but they wove and spun, long staple
and short staple, yellow cotton and white cotton, before
Columbus sailed out of the port of Palos in the <i>Santa
Maria</i>.”</p>

    <div>TO THOSE WHO HAVE THE SUPERINTENDENCY OF EDUCATION.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I ADDRESS myself to all the friends of youth, and
conjure them to direct their compassionate regards to
my unhappy fate, in order to remove the prejudices of which
I am the victim. There are twin sisters of us; and the two
eyes of man do not more resemble, nor are capable of being
upon better terms with each other, than my sister and
myself, were it not for the partiality of our parents, who
make the most injurious distinctions between us. From my
infancy I have been led to consider my sister as a being of
a more elevated rank. I was suffered to grow up without
the least instruction, while nothing was spared in her
education.</p>
<p class='c009'>She had masters to teach her writing, drawing, music, and
other accomplishments; but if by chance I touched a
pencil, a pen, or a needle, I was bitterly rebuked; and
more than once I have been beaten for being awkward, and
wanting a graceful manner. It is true, my sister associated
me with her upon some occasions; but she always made a
point of taking the lead, calling upon me only from necessity,
or to figure by her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>But conceive not, sirs, that my complaints are instigated
merely by vanity. No; my uneasiness is occasioned by an
object much more serious. It is the practice in our family,
that the whole business of providing for its subsistence falls
upon my sister and myself. If any indisposition should
attack my sister,—and I mention it in confidence upon this
occasion, that she is subject to the gout, the rheumatism,
and cramp, without making mention of other accidents,—what
would be the fate of our poor family?</p>

<p class='c009'>Must not the regret of our parents be excessive, at having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>placed so great a difference between sisters who are so
perfectly equal? Alas! we must perish from distress; for
it would not be in my power even to scrawl a suppliant
petition for relief, having been obliged to employ the hand
of another in transcribing the request which I have now the
honour to prefer to you.</p>

<p class='c009'>Condescend, sirs, to make my parents sensible of the
injustice of an exclusive tenderness, and of the necessity of
distributing their care and affection among all their children
equally. I am, with a profound respect, sirs, your obedient
servant,</p>

thought it meet to let them stand by themselves, like the

not to be brought under any Rule: I shall therefore make
bold for this once, to borrow a little of their loose-tongued

<p class='c013'>It is known more then enough, that I am neither Nigard,
nor Cinick, to the due bravery of the true Gentry: if any
man mislikes a bully ’mong drossock more than I, let him
take her for his labour! I honour the woman that can
honour her selfe with her attire: a good Text alwayes deserves
a fair Margent: I am not much offended if I see a trimme,
far trimmer than she that wears it: in a word, whatever
Christianity or Civility will allow, I can afford with <i>London</i>
measure: but when I heare a nugiperous Gentledame
inquire what dresse the Queen is in this week: what the
nudiustertian fashion of the court; I meane the very
newest: with egge to be in it in all haste, what ever it be;
I look at her as the very gizzard of a trifle, the product of
a quarter of a cypher, the epitome of nothing, fitter to be
kickt, if shee were of a kickable substance, than either
honour’d or humour’d.</p>

<p class='c009'>To speak moderately, I truly confesse, it is beyond the
ken of my understanding to conceive, how those women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>should have any true grace, or valuable vertue, that have so
little wit, as to disfigure themselves with such exotick garbes,
as not only dismantles their native lovely lustre, but trans-clouts
them into gant bar-geese, ill-shapen-shotten-shell-fish,
Egyptian hyeroglyphicks, or at the best into French flurts of
the pastery, which a proper English-woman should scorne
with her heels; it is no marvell they weare drailes on the
hinder part of their heads, having nothing as it seems in the
fore part, but a few Squirril’s brains to help them frisk from
one ill-favor’d fashion to another.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The Verses are even enough for such odde pegma’s. I
can make myselfe sicke at any time, with comparing the
dazling splender wherewith our Gentlewomen were embellished
in some former habits, with the goosdom wherewith
they are now surcingled and debauched. Wee have about
five or six of them in our Colony; if I see any of them
accidentally, I cannot cleanse my phansie of them for a
moneth after. I have been a solitary widdower almost twelve
yeares, purposed lately to make a step over to my Native
Country for a yoke fellow; but when I consider how women
there have tripe-wifed themselves with their cladments, I
have no heart to the voyage, least their nauseous shapes and
the Sea, should work too sorely upon my stomach. I speak
sadly; me thinkes it should breake the hearts of Englishmen
to see so many goodly Englishwomen imprisoned in French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Cages, peering out of their hood-holes for some men of mercy
to help them with a little wit, and no body relieves them.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is a more common than convenient saying, that nine
Taylors make a man; it were well if nineteene could make
a woman to her minde; if Taylors were men indeed, well
furnished, but with meer morall principles, they would
disdain to be led about like Apes, by such mymick
Marmosets. It is a most unworthy thing, for men that
have bones in them, to spend their lives in making fidle-cases
for futilous women’s phansies; which are the very
pettitoes of infirmity, the gyblets of perquisquilian toyes.
I am so charitable to think, that most of that mystery
would worke the cheerfuller while they live, if they might
bee well discharged of the tyring slavery of mis-trying
women; it is no little labour to be continually putting up
English-women into Out-landish caskes; who if they be not
shifted anew, once in a few moneths, grow too sowre for
their Husbands. What this Trade will answer for themselves
when God shall take measure of Taylors’ consciences
is beyond my skill to imagine. There was a time when</p>

<p class='c013'>But now our Roses are turned to <i>Flore de lices</i>, our

Hee that makes Coates for the Moone had need take

<p class='c009'>I have often heard divers Ladies vent loud feminine complaints
of the wearisome varieties and chargeable changes
of fashions! I marvell themselves preferre not a Bill of
redresse. I would <i>Essex</i> Ladies would lead the Chore, for
the honour of their County and persons; or rather the
thrice honourable Ladies of the Court, whom it best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>beseemes; who may wel presume of a <i>Le Roy le Veult</i> from
our sober King, a <i>Les Seigneurs ont Assentus</i> from our
prudent Peers, and the like <i>Assentus</i> from our considerate,
I dare not say wife-worne Commons! who I believe had
much rather passe one such Bill, than pay so many Taylors’
Bills as they are forced to doe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most deare and unparallel’d Ladies, be pleased to attempt
it; as you have the precellency of the women of the world
for beauty and feature; so assume the honour to give, and
not take Law from any, in matter of attire; if ye can
transact so faire a motion among yourselves unanimously
I dare say, they that most renite, will least repent. What
greater honour can your Honours desire, than to build a
Promontory president to all foraigne Ladies, to deserve so
eminently at the hands of all the English Gentry present
and to come; and to confute the opinion of all the wise
men in the world; who never thought it possible for women
to doe so good a work?</p>

<p class='c009'>If any man think I have spoken rather merrily than
seriously, he is much mistaken. I have written what I
write with all the indignation I can, and no more than I
ought. I confesse I veer’d my tongue to this kinde of
Language <i>de industria</i> though unwillingly, supposing those
I speak to are uncapable of grave and rationall arguments.</p>

<p class='c009'>I desire all Ladies and Gentlewomen to understand that
all this while I intend not such as through necessary
modesty to avoyd morose singularity, follow fashions slowly,
a flight shot or two off, showing by their moderation that
they rather draw countermont with their hearts, than put on
by their examples.</p>

<p class='c009'>I point my pen only against the light-heel’d beagles that
lead the chase so fast, that they run all civility out of

<p class='c009'>“Hey—what? Oh!—yes,” gruffly replied the clerk, as
he scrutinised the applicant.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is, is it?” was the response.</p>

<p class='c009'>“H—umpse;” heaving a porcine affirmative, much in
use in the city of brotherly love.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am here to see the editor, on business of importance,”
slowly and solemnly articulated Sapid. There must have been
something professionally alarming in this announcement,
if an opinion may be formed from the effect it produced.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Editor’s not come down yet, is he, Spry?” inquired the
clerk, with a cautionary wink at the paste-boy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>“Guess he ain’t more nor up yet,” said Spry; “the

<p class='c009'>“I’ll take a seat till he does come,” observed Sapid,
gloomily.</p>

<p class='c009'>Spry and the clerk laid their heads together in the most
distant corner of the little office.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has he got a stick?” whispered one.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, and he isn’t remarkable big, nuther.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any bit of paper in his hand—does he look like State
House and a libel suit? It’s a’most time—not had a new
suit for a week.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not much; and, as we didn’t have any scrouger in
the <i>Gun</i> yesterday, perhaps he wants to have somebody
tickled up himself. Send him in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>St. Sebastian Sockdolager, Esq., the editor of <i>The National
Pop-gun and Universal Valve Trumpet</i>, sat at a green table,
elucidating an idea by the aid of a steel pen and whity-brown
paper, and therefore St. Sebastian Sockdolager did
not look up when Mr. Sapid entered the sanctum. The
abstraction may, perhaps, have been a sample of literary
stage effect; but it is certain that the pen pursued the idea
with the speed and directness of a steeple-chase, straight
across the paper, and direful was the scratching thereof.
The luckless idea being at last fairly run down and its
brush cut off, Mr. Sockdolager threw himself back into his
chair with a smile of triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tickletoby,” said he, rumpling his hair into heroic
expansiveness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” exclaimed Sapid, rather nervously.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear sir, I didn’t see you—a thousand pardons!
Pray what can be done for you in our line?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, there is a nuisance——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Glad of it, sir; <i>The Gun</i> is death on a nuisance. We
circulate ten thousand deaths to any sort of a nuisance
every day, besides the weekly and the country edition. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>are a regular smash-pipes in that line—surgical, surgical to
this community—we are at once the knife and the sarsaparilla
to human ills, whether financial, political, or social.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir, the nuisance I complain of lies in the circulation—in
its mode and manner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless me,” said Sockdolager, with a look of suspicion,
“you are too literal in your interpretations. If your circulation
is deranged, you had better try Brandreth, or the Fluid
Extract of Quizembob.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not my circulation, but yours, that makes all the
trouble. I never circulate—I can’t without being insulted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, mister, I can’t say that this is clearly comprehensible
to perception. Not circulate! Are you below
par in the money article; or in what particular do you find
yourself in the condition of ‘no go’? Excuse my facetiæ
and be brief, for thought comes tumbling, bumping,
booming——” and Sockdolager dipped his pen in the
ink.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Sappington Sapid unravelled the web of his miseries.
“I wish you, sir, to control your newsboys—to dismiss the
saucy, and to write an article which shall make ’em ashamed
of themselves. I shall call on every editor in the city, sir,
and ask the same—a combined expression for the suppression
of iniquity. We must be emancipated from this new and
growing evil, or our liberties become a farce, and we are
squashed and crushed in a way worse than fifty tea-taxes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pardon me, Mr. Whatcheecallem; it can’t be done—it
would be suicidal, with the sharpest kind of a knife.
Whatcheecallem, you don’t understand the grand movement
of the nineteenth century—you are not up to snuff as to the
vital principle of human progression—the propulsive force
has not yet been demonstrated to your benighted optics.
The sun is up, sir; the hill-tops of intellect glow with its
brightness, and even the level plain of the world’s collective
mediocrity is gilded by its beams; but you, sir, are yet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the foggy valley of exploded prejudice, poking along with a
tuppenny-ha’penny candle—a mere dip. Suppress sauciness!
why, my dear bungletonian, sauciness is the discovery
of the age—the secret of advancement! We are saucy now,
sir, not by the accident of constitution—temperament has
nothing to do with it. We are saucy by calculation, by
intention, by design. It is cultivated, like our whiskers, as
a superadded energy to our other gifts. Without sauciness,
what is a newsboy? what is an editor? what are revolutions?
what are people? Sauce is power. Sauce is spirit,
independence, victory, everything. It is, in fact,—this
sauce, or ‘sass,’ as the vulgar have it,—steam to the great
locomotive of affairs. Suppress, indeed! No, sir; you
should regard it as part of your duty as a philanthropist and
as a patriot to encourage this essence of superiority in all
your countrymen; and I’ve a great mind to write you an
article on that subject instead of the other, for this conversation
has warmed up my ideas so completely that justice
will not be done to the community till they, like you, are
enlightened on this important point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>St. Sebastian Sockdolager, now having a leading article
for <i>The National Pop-gun and Universal Valve Trumpet</i>
clearly in his mind, was not a creature to be trifled with.
An editor in this paroxysm, however gentle in his less
inspired moments, cannot safely be crossed, or even spoken
to. It is not wise to call him to dinner, except through the
keyhole; and to ask for “more copy,” in general a privileged
demand, is a risk too fearful to be encountered. St.
Sebastian’s eye became fixed, his brow corrugated, his
mouth intellectually ajar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, sir, the nuisance,” said Sappington.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t bother!” was the impatient reply, and the brow
of St. Sebastian Sockdolager grew black as his own ink.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The boys, sir, the boys!—am I to be worried out of
my life and soul?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>The right hand of St. Sebastian Sockdolager fell heavily
upon the huge pewter inkstand—the concatenation of his
ideas had been broken—he half raised himself from his
chair and glanced significantly from his visitor to the door.
“Mizzle!” said he, in a hoarse, suppressed whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>The language itself was unintelligible—the word might
have been Chaldaic, for all that Sapid knew to the contrary;
but there are situations in which an interpreter is not
needed, and this appeared to be one of them. Sapid never
before made a movement so swiftly extemporaneous.</p>

<p class='c009'>He intends shortly to try whether the Grand Jury is a
convert to the new doctrine of sauciness.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE BOYS AROUND THE HOUSE.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>SURELY you must have seen a boy of eight or ten years
of age get ready for bed? His shoe-strings are in
a hard knot, and after a few vain efforts to unlace them
he rushes after a case-knife and saws each string in two.
One shoe is thrown under the table, the other behind the
stove, his jacket behind the door, and his stockings are
distributed over as many chairs as they will reach.</p>
<p class='c009'>The boy doesn’t slip his pants off; he struggles out of
them, holding a leg down with his foot and drawing his
limbs out after many stupendous efforts. While doing this
his hands are clutched into the bedclothes, and by the
time he is ready to get into bed the quilts and sheets are
awry and the bed is full of humps and lumps. His brother
has gone through the same motions, and both finally crawl
into bed. They are good boys, and they love each other,
but they are hardly settled on their backs when one cries
out—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hitch along!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t!” bluntly replies the other.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Ma, Bill’s got more’n half the bed!” cries the first.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hain’t either, ma!” replies Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>There is a moment of silence, and then the first
exclaims—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get yer feet off’n me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They hain’t touching you!” is the answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes they be, and you’re on my pillar, too!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! my stars, what a whopper! You’ll never go to
heaven!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mother looks into the bedroom and kindly says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, children, be good, and don’t make your mother
any trouble.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” replies the youngest, “if Bill ’ll tell me a bear
story ’ll go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The mother withdraws, and Bill starts out—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, you know, there was an old bear who lived in a
cave. He was a big black bear. He had eyes like coals of
fire, you know, and when he looked at a feller he——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ma, Bill’s scaring me!” yells Henry, sitting on end.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ma! that’s the awfullest story you ever heard!”
replies Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hitch along, I say!” exclaims Henry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am along!” replies Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get yer knee out’n my back!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hain’t anywhere near ye!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gimme some cloze!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve got more’n half now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, children, do be good and go to sleep,” says the
mother, entering the room and arranging the clothes.</p>

<p class='c009'>They doze off after a few muttered words, to preserve the
peace until morning, and it is popularly supposed that an
angel sits on each bed-post to sentinel either curly head
during the long, dark hours.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho-hum!” yawns Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho-hum!” yawns Henry.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>It is morning, and they crawl out of bed. After four or
five efforts they get into their pants, and then reach out for
stockings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know I put mine right down here by this bed!”
exclaims Bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I put mine right there by the end of the bureau!”
adds Henry.</p>

<p class='c009'>They wander around, growling and jawing, and the
mother finally finds the stockings. Then comes the jackets.
They are positive that they hung them on the hooks, and
boldly charge that some maliciously wicked person removed
them. And so it goes until each one is finally dressed,
washed, and ready for breakfast, and the mother feels such
a burden off her mind that she can endure what follows
their leaving the table—a good half-hour’s hunt after their
hats, which they “positively hung up,” but which are at last
found under some bed, or stowed away behind the woodbox.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>MR. DOTY MAD.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>MR. HENRY K. DOTY, one of the most prominent
citizens, and the leading hide and pelt dealer in the
North-West, has just returned from a European tour. He
has been absent about four months; and in that time he
has made a visit to every European country, and has
become thoroughly acquainted with the customs, manners,
and languages of the different people. He spent about
seventy-five thousand dollars on the trip; but this could
not be called an extravagant sum when one takes into consideration
the superb paintings, statuary, and other works of
virtue that he brought back with him. In Paris, upon the
Roo de Rivoly alone, he purchased fifteen thousand dollars’
worth of pictures; and in Brussels he bought several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>thousand dollars’ worth of those elegant carpets from which
that city derives its name. Mr. Doty says that he was well
treated everywhere except in England. He is specially
bitter against Mr. Phelps, our representative at the court of
St. James.</p>
<p class='c009'>“This man Phelps,” says he, “is a little, dried-up,
snobbish Vermont lawyer, with a soul no bigger than a
huckleberry. I dyed my moustache, and put on my dress-suit
and my twenty-thousand-dollar diamond bosom-pin,
and called to see him. A fine specimen he is to represent
our wealth and culture! I don’t believe his clothes cost
more than twenty dollars a suit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I suppose I ought to call on the queen,’ says I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He didn’t say anything; and I continued, ‘Would you
mind introducing me?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Really, Mr. Doty,’ says he, ‘I do not feel like
presenting an entire stranger to her Majesty.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Oh! you needn’t be scared,’ says I, ‘for I carry as big
a letter of credit as any American in London; and when it
comes to culture, and that sort of thing, I can knock the
socks off any of your lords and marqueezies.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, will you believe it? he had the impudence to
shove a printed list of questions at me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘You will have to answer these on oath before I can tell
you whether I can present you to her Majesty,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was as mad as a Texas steer. Here are some of the
questions: ‘Did you ever have a grandfather? and if so,
what was his vocation?’ ‘Have you contracted the toothbrush
habit?’ ‘Are you addicted to the use of the double
negative?’ ‘Spell phthisis, strychnine, pneumonia?’
Fine questions these to put to a gentleman worth a cool
million! I told him to go to —— with his queen; and I’m
going to have my private secretary write a letter to the
President, complaining of Phelps, and demanding that he
be discharged.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE SHOWMAN’S COURTSHIP.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>THARE was many affectin ties which made me hanker
arter Betsy Jane. Her father’s farm jined our’n;
their cows and our’n squencht their thurst at the same
spring; our old mares both had stars in their forrerds;
the measles broke out in both famerlies at nearly the same
period; our parients (Betsy’s and mine) slept reglarly every
Sunday in the same meetin house, and the nabers used to
obsarve, “How thick the Wards and Peasleys air!” It
was a surblime site, in the Spring of the year, to see our
sevral mothers (Betsy’s and mine) with their gowns pin’d up
so thay couldn’t sile ’em, affecshunitly Bilin sope together
&amp; aboozin the nabers.</p>
<p class='c009'>Altho I hankerd intensly arter the objeck of my affecshuns,
I darsunt tell her of the fires which was rajin in
my manly Buzzom. I’d try to do it but my tung would
kerwollup up agin the roof of my mowth &amp; stick thar, like
deth to a deseast Afrikan, or a country postmaster to his
offiss, while my hart whanged agin my ribs like a old-fashioned
wheat Flale agin a barn door.</p>

<p class='c009'>’Twas a carm still nite in Joon. All nater was husht
and nary zeffer disturbed the sereen silens. I sot with
Betsy Jane on the fense of her farther’s pastur. We’d bin
rompin threw the woods, kullin flours &amp; drivin the woodchuck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>from his Native Lair (so to speak) with long sticks.
Wall we sot thar on the fense, a swingin our feet two and
fro, blushin as red as the Baldinsville skool house when it
was fust painted, and lookin very simple, I make no doubt.
My left arm was ockepied in ballunsin myself on the fense,
while my rite was woundid luvinly round her waste.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I cleared my throat and tremblinly sed, “Betsy, you’re a
Gazelle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought that air was putty fine. I waitid to see what
effeck it would hav upon her. It evidently didn’t fetch her,
for she up and sed—</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“You’re a sheep!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sez I, “Betsy, I think very muchly of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t b’leeve a word you say—so there now cum!”
with which obsarvashun she hitched away from me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish thar was winders to my Sole,” said I, “so that
you could see some of my feelins. There’s fire enuff in
here,” said I, strikin my buzzum with my fist, “to bile all
the corn beef and turnips in the naberhood. Versoovius
and the Critter ain’t a circumstans!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bowd her hed down and commenst chawin the
strings to her sun bonnet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ar could you know the sleeplis nites I worry threw
with on your account, how vittles has seized to be attractiv
to me, &amp; how my lims has shrunk up, you wouldn’t dowt
me. Gase on this wastin form and these ’ere sunken
cheeks——”</p>

<p class='c009'>I should have continnered on in this strane probly for
sum time, but unfortnitly I lost my ballunse and fell over
into the pastur kersmash, tearin my close and seveerly
damagin myself ginerally.</p>

<p class='c009'>Betsy Jane sprung to my assistance in dubble quick time
and dragged me 4th. Then drawin herself up to her full
hite, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t listen to your noncents no longer. Jes say rite
strate out what you’re drivin at. If you mean gettin
hitched, <span class='sc'>I’m in</span>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I considered that air enuff for all practical purpusses, and
we proceeded immejitly to the parson’s, and was made 1
that very nite.</p>

<p class='c009'>(Notiss to the Printer. Put some stars here.)</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>SETTLING UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>STRANGERS visiting the beautiful city of Burlington
have not failed to notice that one of the handsomest
young men they meet is very bald, and they fall into the
usual error of attributing this premature baldness to dissipation.
But such is not the case. This young man,
one of the most exemplary Bible-class scholars in the city,
went to a Baptist sociable out in West Hill one night
about two years ago. He escorted three charming girls,
with angelic countenances and human appetites, out to
the refreshment table, let them eat all they wanted, and
then found he had left his pocket-book at home, and a
deaf man that he had never seen before at the cashier’s
desk. The young man with his face aflame, bent down,
and said softly—</p>
<p class='c009'>“I am ashamed to say I have no change with——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hey——?” shouted the cashier.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I regret to say,” the young man repeated in a little
louder key, “that I have unfortunately come away without
any change to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Change two?” chirped the old man. “Oh, yes; I can
change five if you want it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” the young man explained in a terrible penetrating
whisper, for half-a-dozen people were crowding up behind
him, impatient to pay their bills and get away, “I don’t
want any change, because——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, don’t want no change?” the deaf man cried gleefully.
“’Bleeged to ye, ’bleeged to ye. ’Taint often we
get such generous donations. Pass over your bill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” the young man explained, “I have no
funds——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yes, plenty of fun,” the deaf man replied, growing
tired of the conversation, and noticing the long line of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>people waiting with money in their hands; “but I haven’t
got time to talk about it now. Settle, and move on.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” the young man gasped out, “I have no
money——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go Monday?” queried the deaf cashier. “I don’t
care when you go; you must pay, and let these other people
come up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no money!” the mortified young man shouted,
ready to sink into the earth, while the people all around him,
and especially the three girls he had treated, were giggling
and chuckling audibly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Owe money?” the cashier said; “of course you do;
2.75 dollars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t pay!” the youth screamed, and by turning his
pockets inside out, and yelling his poverty to the heavens,
he finally made the deaf man understand. And then he
had to shriek his full name three times, while his ears fairly
rung with the half-stifled laughter that was breaking out all
around him; and he had to scream out where he worked,
and roar when he would pay, and he couldn’t get the deaf
man to understand him until some of the church members
came up to see what the uproar was, and, recognising their
young friend, made it all right with the cashier. And the
young man went out into the night and clubbed himself,
and shred his locks away ontil he was as bald as an egg.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>MR. HIGGINBOTHAM’S CATASTROPHE.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>A YOUNG fellow, a tobacco pedler by trade, was on his
way from Morristown, where he had dealt largely
with the Deacon of the Shaker settlement, to the village of
Parker’s Falls, on Salmon River. He had a neat little cart,
painted green, with a box of cigars depicted on each side-panel,
and an Indian chief, holding a pipe and a golden
tobacco-stalk, on the rear. The pedler drove a smart little
mare, and was a young man of excellent character, keen at
a bargain, but none the worse liked by the Yankees; who,
as I have heard them say, would rather be shaved with a
sharp razor than a dull one. Especially was he beloved by
the pretty girls along the Connecticut, whose favour he used
to court by presents of the best smoking tobacco in his
stock; knowing well that the country lassies of New
England are generally great performers on pipes. Moreover,
as will be seen in the course of my story, the pedler
was inquisitive, and something of a tattler, always itching to
hear the news and anxious to tell it again.</p>
<p class='c009'>After an early breakfast at Morristown, the tobacco
pedler, whose name was Dominicus Pike, had travelled seven
miles through a solitary piece of woods, without speaking
a word to anybody but himself and his little grey mare. It
being nearly seven o’clock, he was as eager to hold a morning
gossip as a city shopkeeper to reach the morning paper.
An opportunity seemed at hand when, after lighting a cigar
with a sun-glass, he looked up and perceived a man coming
over the brow of a hill, at the foot of which the pedler had
stopped his green cart. Dominicus watched him as he
descended, and noticed that he carried a bundle over his
shoulder on the end of a stick, and travelled with a weary,
yet determined pace. He did not look as if he had started
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>in the freshness of the morning, but had footed it all night,
and meant to do the same all day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, mister,” said Dominicus, when within
speaking distance. “You go a pretty good jog. What’s
the latest news at Parker’s Falls?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man pulled the broad brim of a grey hat over his
eyes, and answered rather sullenly that he did not come
from Parker’s Falls, which, as being the limit of his own
day’s journey, the pedler had naturally mentioned in his
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then,” rejoined Dominicus Pike, “let’s have the
latest news where you did come from. I’m not particular
about Parker’s Falls. Any place will answer.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/ib302.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“AT LAST MOUNTING ON THE STEP OF THE CART, HE WHISPERED IN THE<br />EAR OF DOMINICUS.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Being thus importuned, the traveller—who was as ill-looking
a fellow as one would desire to meet in a solitary
piece of woods—appeared to hesitate a little, as if he was
either searching his memory for news, or weighing the
expediency of telling it. At last mounting on the step of
the cart, he whispered in the ear of Dominicus, though he
might have shouted aloud and no other mortal would have
heard him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do remember one little trifle of news,” said he.
“Old Mr. Higginbotham, of Kimballton, was murdered in
his orchard, at eight o’clock last night, by an Irishman
and a nigger. They strung him up to a branch of a
St. Michael’s pear-tree, where nobody would find him till
the morning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as this horrible intelligence was communicated,
the stranger betook himself to his journey again with more
speed than ever, not even turning his head when Dominicus
invited him to smoke a Spanish cigar and relate all the
particulars. The pedler whistled to his mare and went up
the hill, pondering on the doleful fate of Mr. Higginbotham,
whom he had known in the way of trade, having sold him
many a bunch of long-nines, and a great deal of pig-tail,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>ladies’ twist, and fig tobacco. He was rather astonished
at the rapidity with which the news had spread. Kimballton
was nearly sixty miles distant in a straight line; the
murder had been perpetrated only at eight o’clock the
preceding night; and yet Dominicus had heard of it at
seven in the morning, when in all probability poor Mr.
Higginbotham’s own family had just discovered his corpse
hanging on the St. Michael’s pear-tree. The stranger on
foot must have worn seven-league boots to travel at such
a rate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ill news flies fast, they say,” thought Dominicus Pike;
“but this beats railroads. The fellow ought to be hired
to go express with the President’s message.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The difficulty was solved by supposing that the narrator
had made a mistake of one day in the date of the occurrence;
so that our friend did not hesitate to introduce the
story at every tavern and country store along the road,
expending a whole bunch of Spanish wrappers among
at least twenty horrified audiences. He found himself
invariably the first bearer of the intelligence, and was so
pestered with questions that he could not avoid filling up
the outline, till it became quite a respectable narrative. He
met with one piece of corroborative evidence. Mr. Higginbotham
was a trader; and a former clerk of his, to whom
Dominicus related the facts, testified that the old gentleman
was accustomed to return home through the orchard
about nightfall with the money and valuable papers of the
store in his pocket. The clerk manifested but little grief
at Mr. Higginbotham’s catastrophe, hinting, what the pedler
had discovered in his own dealings with him, that he was
a crusty old fellow, as close as a vice. His property would
descend to a pretty niece, who was now keeping school in
Kimballton.</p>

<p class='c009'>What with telling the news for the public good and
driving bargains for his own, Dominicus was so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>delayed on the road that he chose to put up at a tavern,
about five miles short of Parker’s Falls. After supper,
lighting one of his prime cigars, he seated himself in the
bar-room, and went through the story of the murder, which
had grown so fast that it took him half-an-hour to tell.
There were as many as twenty people in the room,
nineteen of whom received it all for gospel. But the
twentieth was an elderly farmer, who had arrived on horseback
a short time before, and was now seated in a corner
smoking his pipe. When the story was concluded he rose
up very deliberately, brought his chair right in front of
Dominicus, and stared him full in the face, puffing out the
vilest tobacco-smoke the pedler had ever smelt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you make affidavit,” demanded he in the tone of
a country justice taking an examination, “that old Squire
Higginbotham, of Kimballton, was murdered in his orchard
the night before last, and found hanging on his great pear-tree
yesterday morning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell the story as I heard it,” answered Dominicus,
dropping his half-burnt cigar. “I don’t say that I saw the
thing done, so I can’t take my oath that he was murdered
exactly in that way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I can take mine,” said the farmer, “that if Squire
Higginbotham was murdered the night before last, I drank
a bottle of bitters with his ghost this morning. Being a
neighbour of mine he called me into his store as I was
riding by and treated me, and then asked me to do a little
business for him on the road. He didn’t seem to know
any more about his own murder than I did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, then, it can’t be a fact!” exclaimed Dominicus
Pike.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess he’d have mentioned if it was,” said the old
farmer, and he removed his chair back to the corner,
leaving Dominicus quite down in the mouth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here was a sad resurrection of old Mr. Higginbotham!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>The pedler had no heart to mingle in the conversation any
more, but comforted himself with a glass of gin and water
and went to bed, where, all night long, he dreamt of
hanging on the St. Michael’s pear-tree. To avoid the old
farmer (whom he so detested that his suspension would
have pleased him better than Mr. Higginbotham’s),
Dominicus rose in the grey of the morning, put the little
mare into the green cart, and trotted swiftly away towards
Parker’s Falls. The fresh breeze, the dewy road, and the
pleasant summer dawn revived his spirits, and might have
encouraged him to repeat the old story had there been
anybody awake to hear it. But he met neither ox-team,
light waggon, chaise, horseman, nor foot-traveller, till just
as he crossed Salmon River a man came trudging down to
the bridge with a bundle over his shoulder on the end of a
stick.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good morning, mister,” said the pedler, reining in his
mare; “if you come from Kimballton or that neighbourhood
maybe you can tell me the real facts about the affair
of old Mr. Higginbotham. Was the old fellow actually murdered
two or three nights ago by an Irishman and a nigger?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dominicus had spoken in too great a hurry to observe at
first that the stranger himself had a deep tinge of negro
blood. On hearing this sudden question the Ethiopian
appeared to change his skin, its yellow hue becoming a
ghastly white, while shaking and stammering he thus
replied—</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! no! There was no coloured man! It was an
Irishman that hanged him last night at eight o’clock. I
came away at seven! His folks can’t have looked for him
in the orchard yet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely had the yellow man spoken when he interrupted
himself, and though he seemed weary enough before,
continued his journey at a pace which would have kept the
pedler’s mare on a sharp trot. Dominicus stared after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>him in great perplexity. If the murder had not been committed
till Tuesday night, who was the prophet that had
foretold it, in all its circumstances, on Tuesday morning?
If Mr. Higginbotham’s corpse were not yet discovered by
his own family, how came the mulatto, at above thirty miles
distance, to know that he was hanging in the orchard,
especially as he had left Kimballton before the unfortunate
man was hanged at all? These ambiguous circumstances,
with the stranger’s surprise and terror, made Dominicus
think of raising a hue and cry after him, as an accomplice
in the murder, since a murder, it seemed, had really been
perpetrated.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But let the poor devil go,” thought the pedler. “I
don’t want his black blood on my head; and hanging the
nigger won’t unhang Mr. Higginbotham. Unhang the old
gentleman! It’s a sin, I know; but I should hate to have
him come to life a second time, and give me the lie!”</p>

<p class='c009'>With these meditations Dominicus Pike drove into the
street of Parker’s Falls, which, as everybody knows, is as
thriving a village as three cotton factories and a slitting-mill
can make it. The machinery was not in motion, and
but a few of the shop doors unbarred, when he alighted
in the stable-yard of the tavern, and made it his first
business to order the mare four quarts of oats. His
second duty, of course, was to impart Mr. Higginbotham’s
catastrophe to the ostler. He deemed it advisable, however,
not to be too positive as to the date of the direful
fact, and also to be uncertain whether it was perpetrated
by an Irishman and a mulatto, or by the son of Erin alone.
Neither did he profess to relate it on his own authority,
or that of any other person; but mentioned it as a report
generally diffused.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story ran through the town like fire among girdled
trees, and became so much the universal talk that nobody
could tell whence it originated. Mr. Higginbotham was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>as well known at Parker’s Falls as any citizen of the place,
being part-owner of the slitting-mill, and a considerable
stockholder in the cotton factories. The inhabitants felt
their own prosperity interested in his fate. Such was the
excitement that the <i>Parker’s Falls Gazette</i> anticipated its
regular day of publication, and came out with half a form of
blank paper and a column of double pica emphasised with
capitals, and headed <span class='sc'>Horrid Murder of Mr. Higginbotham</span>!
Among other dreadful details, the printed
account described the mark of the cord round the dead
man’s neck, and stated the number of thousand dollars
of which he had been robbed. There was much pathos
also about the affliction of his niece, who had gone from
one fainting fit to another, ever since her uncle was found
hanging on the St. Michael’s pear-tree with his pockets inside
out. The village poet likewise commemorated the young
lady’s grief in seventeen stanzas of a ballad. The select-men
held a meeting, and in consideration of Mr. Higginbotham’s
claims on the town, determined to issue handbills
offering a reward of five hundred dollars for the
apprehension of his murderers and the recovery of the
stolen property.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile the whole population of Parker’s Falls, consisting
of shopkeepers, mistresses of boarding-houses, factory
girls, mill-men and school-boys, rushed into the street, and
kept up such a terrible loquacity as more than compensated
for the silence of the cotton machines, which refrained from
their usual din out of respect to the deceased. Had Mr.
Higginbotham cared about posthumous renown, his untimely
ghost would have exulted in this tumult. Our friend
Dominicus, in his vanity of heart, forgot his intended precautions,
and, mounting on the town pump, announced
himself as the bearer of the authentic intelligence which
had caused so wonderful a sensation. He immediately
became the great man of the moment, and had just began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>a new edition of the narrative with a voice like a field-preacher
when the mail stage drove into the village street.
It had travelled all night, and must have shifted horses at
Kimballton at three in the morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now we shall hear all the particulars,” shouted the
crowd.</p>

<p class='c009'>The coach rumbled up to the piazza of the tavern,
followed by a thousand people; for if any man had been
minding his own business till then, he now left it at sixes
and sevens to hear the news. The pedler, foremost in the
race, discovered two passengers, both of whom had been
startled from a comfortable nap to find themselves in the
centre of a mob. Every man assailed them with separate
questions all propounded at once. The couple were struck
speechless, though one was a lawyer and the other a young
lady.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Higginbotham! Mr. Higginbotham! Tell us the
particulars about old Mr. Higginbotham!” bawled the mob.
“What is the coroner’s verdict? Are the murderers apprehended?
Is Mr. Higginbotham’s niece come out of her
fainting fits? Mr. Higginbotham! Mr. Higginbotham!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The coachman said not a word, except to swear awfully
at the ostler for not bringing him a fresh team of horses.
The lawyer inside had generally his wits about him even
when asleep; the first thing he did, after learning the cause
of the excitement, was to produce a large red pocket-book.
Meanwhile, Dominicus Pike, being an extremely polite
young man, and also suspecting that a female tongue would
tell the story as glibly as a lawyer’s, had handed the lady
out of the coach. She was a fine, smart girl, now wide
awake and bright as a button, and had such a sweet, pretty
mouth, that Dominicus would almost as lieves have heard a
love-tale from it as a tale of murder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gentlemen and ladies,” said the lawyer to the shopkeepers,
the mill-men, and the factory girls, “I can assure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>you that some unaccountable mistake, or more probably, a
wilful falsehood, maliciously contrived to injure Mr. Higginbotham’s
credit, has excited this singular uproar. We
passed through Kimballton at three o’clock this morning,
and most certainly should have been informed of the
murder, had any been perpetrated. But I have proof
nearly as strong as Mr. Higginbotham’s own oral testimony
in the negative. Here is a note relating to a suit of
his in the Connecticut courts, which was delivered me from
that gentleman himself. I find it dated at ten o’clock last
evening.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying the lawyer exhibited the date and signature of
the note, which irrefragably proved, either that this perverse
Mr. Higginbotham was alive when he wrote it, or—as some
deemed the more probable case of two doubtful ones—that
he was so absorbed in worldly business as to continue to
transact it even after his death. But unexpected evidence
was forthcoming. The young lady, after listening to the
pedler’s explanations, merely seized a moment to smooth
her gown and put her curls in order, and then appeared at
the tavern door, making a modest signal to be heard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good people,” said she, “I am Mr. Higginbotham’s
niece.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id039'>
<img src='images/ib310.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“I AM MR. HIGGINBOTHAM’S NIECE.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A wondering murmur passed through the crowd on
beholding her so rosy and bright, the same unhappy niece
whom they had supposed, on the authority of the <i>Parker’s
Falls Gazette</i>, to be lying at death’s door in a fainting fit.
But some shrewd fellow had doubted all along whether a
young lady would be quite so desperate at the hanging of a
rich old uncle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” continued Miss Higginbotham, with a smile,
“that this strange story is quite unfounded, as to myself;
and I believe I may affirm it to be equally so in regard to
my dear uncle Higginbotham. He has the kindness to
give me a home in his house, though I contribute to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>support by teaching a school. I left Kimballton this
morning to spend the vacation of commencement week
with a friend, about five miles from Parker’s Falls. My
generous uncle, when he heard me on the stairs, called me
to his bedside, and gave me two dollars and fifty cents to
pay my stage fare, and another dollar for my extra expenses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>He then laid his pocket-book under his pillow, shook hands
with me, and advised me to take some biscuit in my bag,
instead of breakfasting on the road. I feel confident,
therefore, that I left my beloved relative alive, and trust
that I shall find him so on my return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young lady curtsied at the close of her speech,
which was so sensible, and well-worded, and delivered with
such grace and propriety, that everybody thought her fit to
be Preceptress of the best Academy in the State. But a
stranger would have supposed that Mr. Higginbotham was
an object of abhorrence at Parker’s Falls, and that a thanksgiving
had been proclaimed for his murder, so excessive
was the wrath of the inhabitants on learning their mistake.
The mill-men resolved to bestow public honours on Dominicus
Pike, only hesitating whether to tar and feather him,
ride him on a rail, or refresh him with an ablution at the
town pump, on the top of which he had declared himself
the bearer of the news. The select-men, by the advice of
the lawyer, spoke of prosecuting him for a misdemeanour in
circulating unfounded reports, to the great disturbance of
the peace of the commonwealth. Nothing saved Dominicus
either from mob law or a court of justice but an eloquent
appeal made by the young lady in his behalf. Addressing
a few words of heartfelt gratitude to his benefactress, he
mounted the green cart and drove out of town under a
discharge of artillery from the school-boys, who found
plenty of ammunition in the neighbouring clay-pits and
mud-holes. As he turned his head, to exchange a farewell
glance with Mr. Higginbotham’s niece, a ball, of the consistence
of hasty-pudding, hit him slap in the mouth, giving
him a most grim aspect. His whole person was so bespattered
with the like filthy missiles that he had almost a mind
to ride back and supplicate for the threatened ablution at
the town pump, for, though not meant in kindness, it would
have been a deed of charity.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>However, the sun shone bright on poor Dominicus, and
the mud, an emblem of all stains of undeserved opprobrium,
was easily brushed off when dry. Being a funny rogue, his
heart soon cheered up; nor could he refrain from a hearty
laugh at the uproar which his story excited. The handbills
of the select-men would cause the commitment of all the
vagabonds in the State. The paragraph in the <i>Parker’s Falls
Gazette</i> would be reprinted from Maine to Florida, and
perhaps form an item in the London newspapers; and many
a miser would tremble for his money-bag and life, on learning
the catastrophe of Mr. Higginbotham. The pedler meditated
with much fervour on the charms of the young school-mistress,
and swore that Daniel Webster never spoke nor
looked so like an angel as Miss Higginbotham, while
defending him from the wrathful populace at Parker’s
Falls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dominicus was now on the Kimballton turnpike, having
all along determined to visit that place, though business had
drawn him out of the most direct road from Morristown.
As he approached the scene of the supposed murder, he
continued to revolve the circumstances in his mind, and was
astonished at the aspect which the whole case assumed. Had
nothing occurred to corroborate the story of the first traveller
it might have been considered as a hoax; but the yellow man
was evidently acquainted either with the report or the fact;
and there was a mystery in his dismayed and guilty look on
being abruptly questioned. When to this singular combination
of incidents it was added that the rumour tallied with
Mr. Higginbotham’s character and habits of life; and that
he had an orchard, and a St. Michael’s pear-tree, near which
he always passed at nightfalls, the circumstantial evidence
appeared so strong that Dominicus doubted whether the
autograph produced by the lawyer, or even the niece’s
direct testimony, ought to be equivalent. Making cautious
inquiry along the road, the pedler further learned that Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Higginbotham had in his service an Irishman of doubtful
character, whom he had hired without a recommendation,
on the score of economy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I be hanged myself,” exclaimed Dominicus Pike
aloud, on reaching the top of a lonely hill, “if I believe old
Higginbotham is unhanged, till I see him with my own
eyes, and hear it from his own mouth! And as he’s a real
shaver, I’ll have the minister or some other responsible
man for an endorser.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was growing dusk when he reached the toll-house
on Kimballton turnpike, about a quarter of a mile from
the village of this name. His little mare was fast bringing
him up with a man on horseback, who trotted through
the gate a few rods in advance of him, nodded to the
toll-gatherer, and kept on towards the village. Dominicus
was acquainted with the toll-man, and while making
change, the usual remarks on the weather passed between
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose,” said the pedler, throwing back his whip-lash
to bring it down like a feather on the mare’s flank, “you
have not seen anything of old Mr. Higginbotham within a
day or two?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” answered the toll-gatherer; “he passed the gate
just before you drove up, and yonder he rides now, if you
can see him through the dusk. He’s been to Woodfield
this afternoon, attending a sheriff’s sale there. The old
man generally shakes hands and has a little chat with me;
but to-night he nodded, as if to say, ‘Charge my toll,’ and
jogged on, for wherever he goes, he must always be at
home by eight o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So they tell me,” said Dominicus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never saw a man look so yellow and thin as the
squire does,” continued the toll-gatherer. “Says I to myself
to-night, he’s more like a ghost or an old mummy than
good flesh and blood.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>The pedler strained his eyes through the twilight, and
could just discern the horseman now far ahead on the
village road. He seemed to recognise the rear of Mr.
Higginbotham; and through the evening shadows, and
amid the dust from the horse’s feet, the figure appeared dim
and unsubstantial, as if the shape of the mysterious old man
were faintly moulded of darkness and grey light. Dominicus
shivered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Higginbotham has come back from the other
world, by way of Kimballton turnpike,” thought he.</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook the reins and rode forward, keeping about the
same distance in the rear of the grey old shadow, till the
latter was concealed by a bend of the road. On reaching
this point the pedler no longer saw the man on horseback,
but found himself at the head of the village street, not far
from a number of stores and two taverns, clustered around
the meeting-house steeple. On his left was a stone wall
and a gate, the boundary of a wood-lot, beyond which lay
an orchard; further still, a mowing-field, and, last of all,
a house. These were the premises of Mr. Higginbotham,
whose dwelling stood beside the old highway, but had been
left in the background by the Kimballton turnpike, and
Dominicus knew the place; and the little mare stopped
short by instinct, for he was not conscious of tightening the
reins.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For the soul of me I cannot get by this gate,” said he,
trembling. “I never shall be my own man again till I see
whether Mr. Higginbotham is hanging on the St. Michael
pear-tree!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He leaped from the cart, gave the reins a turn round the
gate-post, and ran along the green path of the wood-lot as
if Old Nick were chasing behind. Just then the village
clock tolled eight, and as each deep stroke fell, Dominicus
gave a fresh bound and flew faster than before, till, dim in
the solitary centre of the orchard, he saw the fated pear-tree.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>One great branch stretched from the old contorted
trunk across the path and threw the darkest shadow on
that one spot. But something seemed to struggle beneath
the branch!</p>

<p><span class='small'>“HE RUSHED FORWARD, PROSTRATED A STURDY IRISHMAN WITH THE<br />BUTT END OF HIS WHIP.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The pedler had never pretended to more courage than
befits a man of peaceable occupation, nor could he account
for his valour on this awful emergency. Certain it is,
however, that he rushed forward, prostrated a sturdy Irishman
with the butt end of his whip, and found—not indeed
hanging on the St. Michael’s pear-tree, but trembling
beneath it, with a halter round his neck—the old, identical
Mr. Higginbotham.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Higginbotham,” said Dominicus tremulously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>“you’re an honest man, and I’ll take your word for it.
Have you been hanged or not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>If the riddle be not already guessed, a few words will
explain the simple machinery by which this coming event
was made to cast its shadow before. Three men had
plotted the robbery and murder of Mr. Higginbotham;
two of them successively lost courage and fled, each
delaying the crime one night by their disappearance; the
third was in the act of perpetration when a champion,
blindly obeying the call of fate, like the heroes of old
romance, appeared in the person of Dominicus Pike.</p>

<p class='c009'>It only remains to say that Mr. Higginbotham took the
pedler into high favour, sanctioned his addresses to the
pretty school-mistress, and settled his whole property on
their children, allowing themselves the interest. In due
time the old gentleman capped the climax of his favours
by dying a Christian death, in bed, since which melancholy
event Dominicus Pike has removed from Kimballton
and established a large tobacco factory in my native
village.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>ANOTHER night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil.
But morning came by-and-by. It was another glad
awakening to fresh breezes, vast expanses of level greensward,
bright sunlight, an impressive solitude utterly without
visible human beings or human habitations, and an
atmosphere of such amazing magnifying properties that trees
that seemed close at hand were more than three miles away.
We resumed undress uniform, climbed a-top of the flying
coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted occasionally
at our frantic mules, merely to see them lay their ears back
and scamper faster, tied our hats on to keep our hair from
blowing away, and levelled an outlook over the world-wide
carpet about us for things new and strange to gaze at.
Even at this day it thrills me through and through to think
of the life, the gladness and the wild sense of freedom, that
used to make the blood dance in my veins on those fine
overland mornings!</p>
<p class='c009'>Along about an hour after breakfast we saw the first
prairie-dog villages, the first antelope, and the first wolf.
If I remember rightly, this latter was the regular <i>cayote</i>
(pronounced ky-<i>o</i>-te) of the farther deserts. And if it <i>was</i>,
he was not a pretty creature or respectable either, for I got
well acquainted with his race afterward, and can speak with
confidence. The cayote is a long, slim, sick- and sorry-looking
skeleton, with a grey wolf-skin stretched over it, a
tolerably bushy tail that for ever sags down with a despairing
expression of forsakenness and misery, a furtive and evil
eye, and a long, sharp face, with slightly lifted lip and
exposed teeth. He has a general slinking expression all
over. The cayote is a living, breathing allegory of want.
He is <i>always</i> hungry. He is always poor, out of luck, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>friendless. The meanest creatures despise him, and even
the fleas would desert him for a velocipede. He is so
spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth
are pretending a threat, the rest of his face is apologising
for it. And he is <i>so</i> homely!—so scrawny, and ribby, and
coarse-haired, and pitiful. When he sees you he lifts his lip
and lets a flash of his teeth out, and then turns a little out
of the course he was pursuing, depresses his head a bit,
and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sage-brush,
glancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he
is about out of easy pistol range, and then he stops and
takes a deliberate survey of you; he will trot fifty yards and
stop again—another fifty and stop again; and finally the
grey of his gliding body blends with the grey of the sagebrush,
and he disappears. All this is when you make no
demonstration against him; but if you do, he develops a
livelier interest in his journey, and instantly electrifies his
heels, and puts such a deal of real estate between himself
and your weapon that by the time you have raised the
hammer you see that you need a minié rifle, and by the
time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon,
and by the time you have “drawn a bead” on him you see
well enough that nothing but an unusually long-winded
streak of lightning could reach him where he is now. But
if you start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy it
ever so much—especially if it is a dog that has a good
opinion of himself, and has been brought up to think he
knows something about speed. The cayote will go swinging
gently off on that deceitful trot of his, and every little while
he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder that will fill
that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly ambition,
and make him lay his head still lower to the ground, and
stretch his neck further to the front, and pant more fiercely,
and stick his tail out straighter behind, and move his
furious legs with a yet wilder frenzy, and leave a broader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and broader, and higher and denser cloud of desert sand
smoking behind, and marking his long wake across the level
plain! And all this time the dog is only a short twenty
feet behind the cayote, and to save the soul of him he
cannot understand why it is that he cannot get perceptibly
closer; and he begins to get aggravated, and it makes him
madder and madder to see how gently the cayote glides
along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he
grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully
he has been taken in by an entire stranger, and what an
ignoble swindle that long, calm, soft-footed trot is; and
next he notices that he is getting fagged, and that the
cayote actually has to slacken speed a little to keep from
running away from him—and <i>then</i> that town-dog is mad in
earnest, and he begins to strain and weep and swear, and
paw the sand higher than ever, and reach for the cayote
with concentrated and desperate energy. This “spurt”
finds him six feet behind the gliding enemy, and two miles
from his friends. And then, in the instant that a wild new
hope is lighting up his face, the cayote turns and smiles
blandly upon him once more, and with a something about
it which seems to say: “Well, I shall have to tear myself
away from you, bub—business is business, and it will not
do for me to be fooling along this way all day”—and forthwith
there is a rushing sound, and the sudden splitting of a
long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that dog is
solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitude!</p>

<p class='c009'>It makes his head swim. He stops and looks all around;
climbs the nearest sand-mound, and gazes into the distance;
shakes his head reflectively, and then, without a word, he
turns and jogs along back to his train, and takes up a
humble position under the hindmost waggon, and feels
unspeakably mean, and looks ashamed, and hangs his tail
at half-mast for a week. And forasmuch as a year after that,
whenever there is a great hue and cry after a cayote, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>dog will merely glance in that direction without emotion,
and apparently observe to himself, “I believe I do not wish
any of the pie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cayote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding
deserts, along with the lizard, the jackass-rabbit, and
the raven, and gets an uncertain and precarious living, and
earns it. He seems to subsist almost wholly on the
carcasses of oxen, mules, and horses that have dropped out
of emigrant trains and died, and upon windfalls of carrion,
and occasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white
men who have been opulent enough to have something
better to butcher than condemned army bacon. He will
eat anything in the world that his first cousins, the desert-frequenting
tribes of Indians, will, and they will eat anything
they can bite. It is a curious fact that these latter
are the only creatures known to history who will eat nitroglycerine
and ask for more if they survive.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cayote of the deserts beyond the Rocky Mountains
has a peculiarly hard time of it, owing to the fact that his
relations, the Indians, are just as apt to be the first to
detect a seductive scent on the desert breeze, and follow the
fragrance to the late ox it emanated from, as he is himself;
and when this occurs he has to content himself with sitting
off at a little distance watching those people strip off and
dig out everything edible, and walk off with it. Then he
and the waiting ravens explore the skeleton and polish the
bones. It is considered that the cayote, and the obscene
bird, and the Indian of the desert, testify their blood
kinship with each other in that they live together in the
waste places of the earth on terms of perfect confidence and
friendship, while hating all other creatures and yearning to
assist at their funerals. He does not mind going a hundred
miles to breakfast, and a hundred and fifty to dinner,
because he is sure to have three or four days between meals,
and he can just as well be travelling and looking at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>scenery as lying around doing nothing and adding to the
burdens of his parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>We soon learned to recognise the sharp, vicious bark of
the cayote as it came across the murky plain at night to
disturb our dreams among the mail-sacks; and remembering
his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune, made shift to wish
him the blessed novelty of a long day’s good luck and a
limitless larder the morrow.</p>

and blowing on the stairs, and pretty soon footsteps
sounded in the hall, and a woman’s voice said—</p>
<p class='c009'>“Now, John Quincy, you want to look as smart as you
can!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>The next moment the door opened, and a big fat
woman and a small thin boy came into the room. She
gave her dress a shake, snatched the boy’s hat off, and
then, looking at me, she inquired—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the head-writer in?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is, madam,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be you him?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>I nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” she exclaimed, as she sat down on a chair
and fanned herself with her handkerchief; “I like to have
never got upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I smiled and nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see that boy thar?” she inquired after a while.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your son, I suppose?” I answered; “nice-looking lad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, he’s smart as a fox. There isn’t a thing he don’t
know. Why, he isn’t but eight, and he composes poetry,
writes letters, and plays tunes on the fiddle!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ought to be proud of him,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, we kinder hope he’ll turn out well,” she answered.
“Come up here, John Quincy, and speak that piece about
that boy who stood on the busted deck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t!” replied the boy in a positive tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s a little bashful, you see,” giving me an apologetical
smile. “He’s rid fourteen miles this morning, and he
doesn’t feel well, anyhow; I shouldn’t wonder if he was
troubled with worums.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Worms be blowed!” replied John Quincy, chewing
away at his hat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s awful skeard when he’s among strangers,” she
went on; “but he’ll git over it in a short time. What I
cum in for was to see if you wouldn’t take him and make a
head-writer of him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t want to be a durned old bald-headed head-writer!”
said John Quincy, picking his teeth with my
scissors.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“The young never knows what’s good for ’em,” she went
on. “He wants to be a preacher, or a great lawyer, or a
big doctor; but he seems to take to writing, and we
thought we’d make a head-writer of him. I don’t sopose
he’d earn over five or six dollars and board a week for the
first year, but I’ve bin told that Gen’ral Jackson didn’t get
half that when he begun.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madam,” I commenced, as she stopped for breath,
“I’d like to take the boy. He looks as smart as a steel
trap, and no doubt he’ll turn out a great man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you’ll take him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you agree as to terms.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is them ter-ums?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see my left eye is out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, your son can never become a great writer unless
you put his left eye out. If you will think back you will
remember that you never saw a great writer whose left eye
was not out. This is a matter of economy. A one-eyed
writer only needs half as much light as a man with two
eyes, and he isn’t half so apt to discover hair-pins in his
butter, and buttons in his oyster soup. The best way to
put his eye out is to jab a red-hot needle into it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good grashus!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you observe that I am bald-headed? You may
think that my baldness results from scalp disease, but such
is not the case. When a head-writer is bothered to get an
idea he scratches his head. Scratching the hair wouldn’t
do any good; it’s the scalp he must agitate. The hair is
therefore pulled out with a pair of pincers, in order that a
man can get right down to the scalp at once, and save time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can that be possible?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All this is strictly true, madam. You also observe that
one of my legs is shorter than the other. Without an
explanation on my part you would attribute this to some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>accident. Such is not the case. Every head-writer is
located in the fourth storey of the office, and his left leg is
shortened three inches to enable him to run up and down
stairs. You will have to have a doctor unjoint your son’s
leg at the hip, saw it off to the proper length, and then
hook it back in its place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did I ever hear the likes!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you also observe, madam, that two of my front
teeth are gone. You might think they decayed, but such
was not the case. They were knocked out with a crowbar
in order to enable me to spit ten feet. According to a law
enacted at the last Session of Congress, any head-writer
who can’t spit ten feet is not entitled to receive Congressional
reports free of postage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can it be so?” she said, her eyes growing larger every
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you notice my corpulent build?” I went on; “you
might think this the result of high-living, but it is not.
Every head-writer of any prominence has one of these big
stomachs on him. They are all members of a secret
society, and they tell each other outside of the lodge-room
in this way: I am naturally very tall and thin, but I had to
conform to the rules. They cut a hole in my chest and
filled me out by stuffing in dry Indian meal. It took two
bushels and a peck, and then it lacked a little, and they
had to fill up with oatmeal. Now then, madam, you see
what your son must go through with, and I leave you to
judge whether you will have him learn the head-writer’s
trade or not. I like the looks of the boy very much, and if
you desire to——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I guess we’ll go hum!” she exclaimed, lifting herself
off the chair. “I kinder want him to be a head-writer, and
yit I think I ought to have a little more talk with his father,
who wants him to git to be boss in a saw-mill. I’m ’bleged
to you, and if we conclude to have him——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“Yes, bring him right in, day or night. The first thing
will be to unhinge his left leg and——!”</p>

<p><span class='small'>“HE DON’T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>IT is a curious thing—an unpleasant thing—a very
embarrassing sort of thing—but the truth must be
told—if not at all times, at least sometimes; and truth
now compels the declaration that Peleg W. Ponder, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>character is here portrayed, let him travel in any way, cannot
arrive at a conclusion. He never had one of his own.
He scarcely knows a conclusion, even if he should chance
to see one belonging to other people, and, as for reaching
a result, he would never be able to do it, if he could stretch
like a giraffe. Results are beyond his compass. And his
misfortune is, perhaps, hereditary, his mother’s name having
been Mrs. Perplexity Ponder, whose earthly career came
to an end while she was in dubitation as to which of the
various physicians of the place should be called in. If
there had been only one doctor in the town, Perplexity
Ponder might have been saved. But there was many—and
what could Perplexity do in such a case?</p>
<p class='c009'>Ponder’s father was run over by a waggon, as he stood
debating with himself, in the middle of the road, whether
he should escape forward or retreat backward. There were
two methods of extrication, and between them both old
Ponder became a victim. How then could their worthy
son, Peleg, be expected to arrive at a conclusion? He
never does.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet, for one’s general comfort and particular happiness,
there does not appear to be any faculty more desirable than
the power of “making up the mind.” Right or wrong, it
saves a deal of wear and tear; and it prevents an infinite
variety of trouble. Commend us to the individual who
chooses upon propositions like a nutcracker—whose promptness
of will has a sledge-hammer way with it, and hits nails
continually on the head. Genius may be brilliant—talent
commanding! but what is genius, or what is talent, if it
lack that which we may call the clinching faculty—if it
hesitates, veers, and flutters—suffers opportunities to pass,
and stumbles at occasion? To reason well is much, no
doubt, but reason loses the race if it sits in meditation
on the fence when competition rushes by.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under the best of circumstances, something must be left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>to hazard. There is a chance in all things. No man can
so calculate odds in the affairs of life as to ensure a certainty.
The screws and linchpins necessary to our purpose have
not the inflexibility of fate; yet they must be trusted at
some degree of risk. Our candle may be put out by a puff
of wind on the stair, let it be sheltered ever so carefully.
Betsy is a good cook, yet beefsteaks have been productive
of strangulation. Does it then follow from this that we are
never to go to bed, except in the dark, and to abstain from
breaking our fast until dinner is announced?</p>

<p class='c009'>One may pause and reflect too much. There must be
action, conclusion, result, or we are a failure, to all intents
and purposes—a self-confessed failure—defunct from the
beginning. And such was the case with Peleg W. Ponder,
who never arrived at a conclusion, or contrived to reach a
result. Peleg is always “stumped”—he “don’t know what
to think”—he “can’t tell what to say”—an unfinished
gentleman, with a mind like a dusty garret, full, as it were,
of rickety furniture, yet nothing serviceable—broken-backed
chairs—three-legged tables—pitchers without handles—cracked
decanters and fractured looking-glasses—that
museum of mutilations in which housewifery rejoices, under
the vague but never realised hope that these things may
eventually “come in play.” Peleg’s opinions lie about the
workshop of his brains, in every stage of progress but the
last—chips, sticks, and sawdust enough, but no article
ready to send home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Should you meet Peleg in the street with “Good
morning, Peleg—how do you find yourself to-day?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well—I don’t know exactly—I’m pretty—no, not very—pray,
how do you do yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now if a man does not know exactly, or nearly, how
he is after being up for several hours, and having had
abundant time to investigate the circumstances of his case,
it is useless to propound questions of opinion to such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>individual. It is useless to attempt it with Peleg. “How
do you do?” puzzles him—he is fearful of being too rash,
and of making a reply which might not be fully justified by
after-reflection. His head may be about to ache, and he
has other suspicious feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“People are always asking me how I do, and more than
half the time I can’t tell. There’s a good many different
sorts of ways of feeling betwixt and between ‘Very sick, I
thank you,’ and ‘Half-dead, I’m obliged to you;’ and
people won’t stop to hear you explain the matter. They
want to know right smack, when you don’t know right
smack yourself. Sometimes you feel things a-coming, and
just after you feel things a-going. And nobody’s exactly
prime all the while. I ain’t, anyhow—I’m kinder so just
now, and I’m sorter t’other way just after. Then, some
people tell you that you look very well, when you don’t feel
very well—how then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>At table Peleg is not exactly sure what he will take; and
sits looking slowly up and down the board, deliberating
what he would like, until the rest of the company have
finished their repast, there being often nothing left which
suits Peleg’s hesitating appetite.</p>

<p class='c009'>Peleg has never married—not that he is averse to the
connubial state—on the contrary, he has a large share of
the susceptibilities, and is always partially in love. But
female beauty is so various. At one time Peleg is inclined
to believe that perfection lies in queenly dignity—the
majesty of an empress fills his dreams; and he looks down
with disdain on little people. He calls them “squabs” in
derogation. But anon, in a more domestic mood, he
thinks of fireside happiness and quiet bliss, declining from
the epic poetry of loveliness to the household wife, who
might be disposed to bring him his slippers, and to darn
the hole in his elbow. When in the tragic vein he fancies
a brunette; and when the sunshine is on his soul, blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>eyes are at a premium. Should woman possess the slightness
of a sylph, or should her charms be of the more solid
architecture? Ought her countenance to beam in smiles,
or will habitual pensiveness be the more interesting? Is
sparkling brilliancy to be preferred to gentle sweetness?</p>

<p class='c009'>“If there wasn’t so many of them, I shouldn’t be so
bothered,” said Peleg; “or if they all looked alike, a man
couldn’t help himself. But yesterday I wanted this one;
to-day, I want that one; and to-morrow I’ll want t’other
one; and how can I tell, if I should get this, or that, or
t’other, that it wouldn’t soon be somebody else that I really
wanted? That’s the difficulty. It always happens so with
me. When the lady’s most courted, and thinks I ought to
speak out, then I begin to be skeered, for fear I’ve made a
mistake, and have been thinking I loved her, when I didn’t.
Maybe it’s not the right one—maybe she won’t suit—maybe
I might do better—maybe I had better not venture at all.
I wish there wasn’t so many ‘maybe’s’ about everything,
especially in such affairs. I’ve got at least a dozen
unfinished courtships on hand already.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But all this happened a long time ago; and Peleg has
gradually lost sight of his fancy for making an addition to
his household. Not that he has concluded, even yet, to
remain a bachelor. He would be alarmed at the bare
mention of such an idea. He could not consent to be
shelved in that decisive manner. But he has subsided
from active “looking around” in pursuit of his object, into
that calm, irresponsible submissiveness, characteristic of the
somewhat elderly bachelor, which waits until she may
chance to present herself spontaneously, and “come along”
of her own accord. “Some day—some day,” says Peleg;
“it will happen some day or other. What’s the use of being
in a hurry?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Peleg W. Ponder’s great object is now ambition. His
personal affairs are somewhat embarrassed by his lack of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>enterprise, and he hankers greatly for an office. But which
side to join? Ay, there’s the rub! Who will purvey the
loaf and fish? for whom shall Peleg shout?</p>

<p class='c009'>Behold him as he puzzles over the returns of the State
elections, labouring in vain to satisfy his mind as to the
result of the presidential contest. Stupefied by figures—perplexed
by contradictory statements—bothered by the
general hurrah; what can Peleg do?</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s going to win? That’s all I want to know,”
exclaims the vexed Peleg. “I don’t want to waste my
time a-blowing out for the wrong person, and never get a
thank’e. What’s the use of that? There’s Simpkins—says
I, Simpkins, says I, which is the party that can’t be beat?
And Simpkins turns up his nose and tells me every fool
knows that—it’s his side—so I hurrah for Simpkins’ side as
hard as I can. But then comes Timpkins—Timpkins’ side
is t’other side from Simpkins’ side—and Timpkins offers to
bet me three levies that his side is the side that can’t be
beat. Hurrah! says I, for Timpkins’ side!—and then I
can’t tell which side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As for the newspapers, that’s worse still. They not only
crow all round, but they cipher it out so clear that both
sides must win, if there’s any truth in the ciphering-book;
which there isn’t about election time. What’s to be done?
I’ve tried going to all the meetings—I’ve hurrahed for everybody—I’ve
been in all the processions, and I sit a little
while every evening in all sorts of headquarters. I’ve got
one kind of documents in one pocket, and t’other kind of
documents in t’other pocket; and as I go home at night I
sing one sort of song as loud as I can bawl half of the way,
and try another sort of song the rest of the way, just to
split the difference and show my impartiality. If I only
had two notes—a couple of ’em—how nice it would be!</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the best thing that can be done now, I guess, as
my character is established both ways, is to turn in quietly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>till the row is all over. Nobody will miss me when they
are all so busy; and afterwards, when we know all about it,
just look for Peleg W. Ponder as he comes down the street,
shaking people by the hand, and saying how we have used
them up. I can’t say so now, or I would, for I am not
perfectly sure yet which is ‘we’ or which is ‘them.’ Time
enough when the election is over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It will thus be seen that Ponder is a remarkable person.
Peter Schlemihl lost his shadow and became memorably
unhappy in consequence; but what was his misfortune when
compared with that of the man who has no side? What
are shadows if weighed against sides? And Peleg is
almost afraid that he never will be able to get a side, so
unlucky has he been heretofore. He begins to dread that
both sides may be defeated; and then, let us ask, what is
to become of him? Must he stand aside?</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>THE Shakers is the strangest religious sex I ever met.</p>

<p class='c009'>I’D hearn tell of ’em and I’d seen ’em, with their
broad brim’d hats and long wastid coats; but I’d never cum
into immejit contack with ’em and I’d sot ’em down as
lackin intelleck, as I’d never seen ’em to my Show—leastways,
if they cum they was disgised in white peple’s close,
so I didn’t know ’em.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in the Spring of 18— I got swampt in the exterior of
New York State, one dark and stormy night, when the winds
Blue pityusly, and I was forced to tie up with the Shakers.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was toilin threw the mud, when in the dim vister of the
futer I obsarved the gleams of a taller candle. Tiein a
hornet’s nest to my off hoss’s tail to kinder encourage him,
I soon reached the place. I knockt at the door, which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>was opened unto me by a tall, slick-faced, solum lookin
individooal, who turn’d out to be a Elder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mr. Shaker,” sed I, “you see before you a Babe in the
Woods, so to speak, and he axes shelter of you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay,” sed the Shaker, and he led the way into the
house, another Shaker bein sent to put my hosses and
waggin under kiver.</p>

<p class='c009'>A solum female, lookin sumwhat like a last year’s beanpole
stuck into a long meal bag, cum in and axed me was I
athurst and did I hunger? to which I urbanely anserd
“a few.” She went orf and I endeverd to open a conversashun
with the old man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Elder, I spect?” sed I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay,” he sed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Helth’s good, I reckon?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the wages of a Elder, when he understans his
bizness—or do you devote your sarvices gratooitus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stormy night, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the storm continners there’ll be a mess underfoot, hay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s onpleasant when there’s a mess underfoot?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I may be so bold, kind sir, what’s the price of that
pecooler kind of weskit you wear, incloodin trimmins?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I pawsd a minit, and then, thinkin I’d be faseshus with
him and see how that would go, I slapt him on the shoulder,
bust into a harty larf, and told him that as a <i>yayer</i> he had
no livin ekal.</p>

<p class='c009'>He jumpt up as if Bilin water had bin squirted into his
ears, groaned, rolled his eyes up tords the sealin and sed:
“You’re a man of sin!” He then walkt out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Jest then the female in the meal bag stuck her hed into
the room and statid that refreshments awaited the weary
travler, and I sed if it was vittles she ment the weary
travler was agreeable, and I follered her into the next room.</p>

<p class='c009'>I sot down to the table and the female in the meal bag
pored out sum tea. She sed nothin, and for five minutes
the only live thing in that room was a old wooden clock,
which tickt in a subdood and bashful manner in the corner.
This dethly stillness made me oneasy, and I determined to
talk to the female or bust. So sez I, “Marrige is agin your
rules, I bleeve, marm?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sexes liv strickly apart, I spect?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s kinder singler,” sez I, puttin on my most sweetest
look and speakin in a winnin voice, “that so fair a made as
thou never got hitched to some likely feller.” [N.B.—She
was upards of 40 and homely as a stump fence, but I thawt
I’d tickil her.]</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t like men!” she sed, very short.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, I dunno,” sez I, “they’re a rayther important part
of the populashun. I don’t scarcely see how we could git
along without ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Us poor wimin folks would git along a grate deal better
if there was no men!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ll excoos me, marm, but I don’t think that air
would work. It wouldn’t be regler.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m afraid of men!” she sed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s onnecessary, marm. <i>You</i> ain’t in no danger.
Don’t fret yourself on that pint.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here, we’re shot out from the sinful world. Here, all
is peas. Here, we air brothers and sisters. We don’t
marry and consekently we hav no domestic difficulties.
Husbans don’t abooze their wives—wives don’t worrit their
husbans. There’s no children here to worrit us. Nothin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>to worrit us here. No wicked matrimony here. Would
thow like to be a Shaker?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” sez I, “it ain’t my stile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I had now histed in as big a load of pervishuns as I could
carry comfortable, and, leanin back in my cheer, commenst
pickin my teeth with a fork. The female went out, leavin
me all alone with the clock. I hadn’t sot thar long before
the Elder poked his hed in at the door. “You’re a man of
sin!” he sed, and groaned and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Direckly thar cum in two young Shakeresses, as putty and
slick lookin gals as I ever met. It is troo they was dressed
in meal bags like the old one I’d met previsly, and their
shiny, silky har was hid from sight by long white caps, sich
as I spose female Josts wear; but their eyes sparkled like
diminds, their cheeks was like roses, and they was charmin
enuff to make a man throw stuns at his granmother, if they
axed him to. They commenst clearin away the dishes,
castin shy glances at me all the time. I got excited. I forgot
Betsy Jane in my rapter, and sez I, “My pretty dears,
how air you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We air well,” they solumly sed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whar’s the old man?” sed I, in a soft voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of whom dost thow speak—Brother Uriah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean the gay and festiv cuss who calls me a man of
sin. Shouldn’t wonder if his name was Uriah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has retired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, my pretty dears,” sez I, “let’s have sum fun. Let’s
play puss in the corner. What say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Air you a Shaker, sir?” they axed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall, my pretty dears, I havn’t arrayed my proud form
in a long weskit yit, but if they was all like you perhaps
I’d jine ’em. As it is, I’m a Shaker pro-temporary.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They was full of fun. I seed that at fust, only they was
a leetle skeery. I tawt ’em Puss in the corner and sich
like plase, and we had a nice time, keepin quiet of course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>so the old man shouldn’t hear. When we broke up, sez I,
“My pretty dears, ear I go you hav no objections, hav you,
to a innersent kiss at partin?”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Yay,” they sed, and I <i>yay’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went up stairs to bed. I spose I’d been snoozin half a
hour when I was woke up by a noise at the door. I sot up
in bed, leanin on my elbers and rubbin my eyes, and I saw
the follerin picter: The Elder stood in the doorway, with a
taller candle in his hand. He hadn’t no wearin appeerel on
except his night close, which fluttered in the breeze like a
Seseshun flag. He sed, “You’re a man of sin!” then
groaned and went away.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to sleep agin, and drempt of runnin orf with the
pretty little Shakeresses, mounted on my Californy Bar. I
thawt the Bar insisted on steerin strate for my dooryard in
Baldinsville, and that Betsy Jane cum out and giv us a
warm recepshun with a panfull of bilin water. I was woke
up arly by the Elder. He sed refreshments was reddy for
me down stairs. Then sayin I was a man of sin, he went
groanin away.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I was goin threw the entry to the room where the
vittles was, I cum across the Elder and the old female I’d
met the night before, and what d’ye spose they was up to?
Huggin and kissin like young lovers in their gushingist
state. Sez I, “My Shaker frends, I reckon you’d better
suspend the rules, and git marrid!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must excoos Brother Uriah,” sed the female; “he’s
subjeck to fits, and hain’t got no command over hisself
when he’s into ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sartinly,” sez I, “I’ve bin took that way myself frequent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a man of sin!” sed the Elder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arter breakfust my little Shaker frends cum in agin to
clear away the dishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My pretty dears,” sez I, “shall we <i>yay</i> agin?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay,” they sed, and I <i>nay’d</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>The Shakers axed me to go to their meetin, as they was
to hav sarvices that mornin, so I put on a clean biled rag
and went. The meetin house was as neat as a pin. The
floor was white as chalk and smooth as glass. The Shakers
was all on hand, in clean weskits and meal bags, ranged on
the floor like milingtery companies, the mails on one side of
the room, and the females on tother. They commenst
clappin their hands and singin and dancin. They danced
kinder slow at fust, but as they got warmed up they
shaved it down very brisk, I tell you. Elder Uriah, in
particler, exhiberted a right smart chance of spryness
in his legs, considerin his time of life, and as he cum a
double shuffle near where I sot, I rewarded him with a
approvin smile and said, “Hunky boy! Go it, my gay and
festiv cuss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re a man of sin!” he said, continnering his shuffle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sperret, as they called it, then moved a short fat
Shaker to say a few remarks. He sed they was Shakers,
and all was ekal. They was the purest and seleckest peple
on the yearth. Other peple was sinful as they could be,
but Shakers was all right. Shakers was all goin kerslap to
the Promist Land, and nobody want goin to stand at the
gate to bar ’em out, if they did they’d git run over.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Shakers then danced and sung agin, and arter they
was threw, one of ’em axed me what I thawt of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sez I, “What does it siggerfy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?” sez he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why this jumpin up and singin? This long weskit
bizniss, and this anty-matrimony idee? My frends, you air
neat and tidy. Your lands is flowin with milk and honey.
Your brooms is fine, and your apple sass is honest. Wehn
a man buys a kag of apple sass of you he don’t find a grate
many shavins under a few layers of sass—a little Game I’m
sorry to say sum of my New Englan ancesters used to
practiss. Your garding seeds is fine, and if I should sow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>’em on the rock of Gibralter probly I should raise a good
mess of garding sass. You air honest in your dealins.
You air quiet and don’t distarb nobody. For all this I givs
you credit. But your religion is small pertaters, I must say.
You mope away your lives here in single retchidness, and as
you air all by yourselves nothing ever conflicts with your
pecooler idees, except when Human Nater busts out among
you, as I understan she sumtimes do. [I give Uriah a sly
wink here, which made the old feller squirm like a speared
Eel.] You wear long weskits and long faces, and lead a
gloomy life indeed. No children’s prattle is ever hearn

  <h2 class='c004'><i>HOW SANTA CLAUS CAME TO SIMPSON’S BAR.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>IT had been raining in the valley of Sacramento. The
North Fork had overflowed its banks and Rattlesnake
Creek was impassable.</p>
<p class='c009'>The few boulders that had marked the summer ford at
Simpson’s Crossing were obliterated by a vast sheet of
water stretching to the foothills. The up stage was stopped
at Granger’s; the last mail had been abandoned in the
<i>tules</i>, the rider swimming for his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“An area,” remarked the <i>Sierra Avalanche</i> with pensive
local pride, “as large as the State of Massachusetts is now
under water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor was the weather any better in the foothills.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mud lay deep on the mountain road; waggons that
neither physical force nor moral objurgation could move
from the evil ways into which they had fallen, encumbered
the track, and the way to Simpson’s Bar was indicated by
broken-down teams and hard swearing.</p>

<p class='c009'>And farther on, cut-off and inaccessible, rained upon
and bedraggled, smitten by high winds and threatened by
high water, Simpson’s Bar, on the eve of Christmas Day,
1862, clung like a swallow’s nest to the rocky entablature
and splintered capitals of Table Mountain, and shook in
the blast.</p>

<p class='c009'>As night shut down on the settlement, a few lights
gleamed through the mist from the windows of cabins
on either side of the highway now crossed and gullied by
lawless streams and swept by marauding winds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Happily most of the population were gathered at
Thompson’s store, clustered around a red-hot stove, at which
they silently spat in some accepted sense of social communion
that perhaps rendered conversation unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Indeed most methods of diversion had long since been
exhausted on Simpson’s Bar; high water had suspended
the regular occupations on gulch and on river, and a
consequent lack of money and whisky had taken the
zest from most illegitimate recreation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even Mr. Hamlin was fain to leave the Bar with fifty
dollars in his pocket—the only amount actually realised
of the large sums won by him in the successful exercise
of his arduous profession.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ef I was asked,” he remarked somewhat later—“ef I
was asked to pint out a purty little village where a retired
sport as didn’t care for money could exercise hisself
frequent and lively, I’d say Simpson’s Bar; but for a
young man with a large family depending on his exertions,
it don’t pay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Mr. Hamlin’s family consisted mainly of female
adults, this remark is quoted rather to show the breadth
of his humour than the exact extent of his responsibilities.</p>

<p class='c009'>Howbeit, the unconscious objects of this satire sat that
evening in the listless apathy begotten of idleness and lack
of excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the sudden splashing of hoofs before the door
did not arouse them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick Bullen alone paused in the act of scraping out
his pipe, and lifted his head; but no other one of the
group indicated any interest in, or recognition of, the
man who entered.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a figure familiar enough to the company, and
known in Simpson’s Bar as “The Old Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A man of perhaps fifty years, grizzled and scant of hair,
but still fresh and youthful of complexion. A face full of
ready, but not very powerful sympathy, with a chameleon-like
aptitude for taking on the shade and colour of contiguous
moods and feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had evidently just left some hilarious companions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>and did not at first notice the gravity of the group, but
clapped the shoulder of the nearest man jocularly, and
threw himself into a vacant chair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jest heard the best thing out, boys! Ye know Smiley,
over yar—Jim Smiley—funniest man in the Bar? Well,
Jim was jest telling the richest yarn about——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Smiley’s a —— fool,” interrupted a gloomy voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A particular —— skunk,” added another, in sepulchral
accents.</p>

<p class='c009'>A silence followed these positive statements.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man glanced quickly around the group. Then
his face slowly changed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s so,” he said reflectively, after a pause; “certainly
a sort of a skunk and suthin’ of a fool. In course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was silent for a moment, as in painful contemplation
of the unsavouriness and folly of the unpopular Smiley.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dismal weather, ain’t it?” he added, now fully embarked
on the current of prevailing sentiment. “Mighty
rough papers on the boys, and no show for money this
season. And to-morrow’s Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a movement among the men at this announcement,
but whether of satisfaction or disgust was not plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” continued the Old Man in the lugubrious tone he
had within the last few moments unconsciously adopted—“yes,
Christmas, and to-night’s Christmas-eve. Ye see,
boys, I kinder thought—that is, I sorter had an idee, jest
passin like you know—that may be ye’d all like to come
over to my house to-night and have a sort of tear round.
But I suppose, now, you wouldn’t? Don’t feel like it, may
be?” he added, with anxious sympathy, peering into the
faces of his companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I don’t know,” responded Tom Flynn, with some
cheerfulness. “P’r’aps we may. But how about your wife,
Old Man? What does she say to it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man hesitated.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>His conjugal experience had not been a happy one, and
the fact was known to Simpson’s Bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>His first wife, a delicate, pretty little woman, had suffered
keenly and secretly from the jealous suspicions of her
husband, until one day he invited the whole Bar to his
house to expose her infidelity.</p>

<p class='c009'>On arriving, the party found the shy, <i>petite</i> creature
quietly engaged in her household duties, and retired
abashed and discomfited.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the sensitive woman did not easily recover from the
shock of this extraordinary outrage.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was with difficulty she regained her equanimity
sufficiently to release her lover from the closet in which
he was concealed, and escape with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>She left a boy of three years to comfort her bereaved
husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man’s present wife had been his cook. She
was large, loyal, and aggressive.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before he could reply, Joe Dimmick suggested with great
directness that it was the “Old Man’s house,” and that,
invoking the Divine Power, if the case were his own, he
would invite who he pleased, even if in so doing he
imperilled his salvation. The Powers of Evil, he further
remarked, should contend against him vainly.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this delivered with a terseness and vigour lost in
this necessary translation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In course. Certainly. Thet’s it,” said the Old Man
with a sympathetic frown. “Thar’s no trouble about thet.
It’s my own house, built every stick on it myself. Don’t
you be afeared o’ her, boys. She may cut up a trifle rough—ez
wimmin do—but she’ll come round.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Secretly the Old Man trusted to the exultation of liquor
and the power of a courageous example to sustain him in
such an emergency.</p>

<p class='c009'>As yet, Dick Bullen, the oracle and leader of Simpson’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Bar, had not spoken. He now took his pipe from his
lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old Man, how’s that yer Johnny gettin’ on? Seems to
me he didn’t look so peart the last time I seed him on the
bluff heavin’ rocks at Chinamen. Didn’t seem to take
much interest in it. Thar was a gang of ’em by yar yesterday—drownded
out up the river—and I kinder thought o’
Johnny, and how he’d miss ’em! May be now, we’d be in
the way ef he was sick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The father, evidently touched not only by this pathetic
picture of Johnny’s deprivation, but by the considerate
delicacy of the speaker, hastened to assure him that Johnny
was better, and that a “little fun might ’liven him up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Whereupon Dick arose, shook himself, and saying, “I’m
ready. Lead the way, Old Man: here goes,” himself led
the way with a leap, a characteristic howl, and darted out
into the night.</p>

<p class='c009'>As he passed through the outer room he caught up a
blazing brand from the hearth.</p>

<p class='c009'>The action was repeated by the rest of the party, closely
following and elbowing each other, and before the
astonished proprietor of Thompson’s grocery was aware
of the intention of his guests, the room was deserted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The night was pitchy dark. In the first gust of wind
their temporary torches were extinguished, and only the red
brands dancing and flitting in the gloom like drunken will-o’-the-wisps
indicated their whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their way led up Pine Tree Cañon, at the head of which
a broad, low bark-thatched cabin burrowed in the mountainside.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the home of the Old Man, and the entrance to the
tunnel in which he worked, when he worked at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the crowd paused for a moment, out of delicate
deference to their host, who came up panting in the rear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“P’r’aps ye’d better hold on a second out yer, whilst I go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>in and see thet things is all right,” said the Old Man, with
an indifference he was far from feeling.</p>

<p class='c009'>The suggestion was graciously accepted, the door opened
and closed on the host, and the crowd, leaning their backs
against the wall, and cowering under the eaves, waited and
listened.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a few moments there was no sound but the dripping
of water from the eaves, and the stir and rustle of wrestling
boughs above them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the men became uneasy, and whispered suggestion
and suspicion passed from the one to the other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Reckon she’s caved in his head the first lick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Decoyed him inter the tunnel, and barred him up,
likely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Got him down, and sittin’ on him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prob’ly biling suthing to heave on us; stand clear the
door, boys!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For just then the latch clicked, the door slowly opened,
and a voice said—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in out o’ the wet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The voice was neither that of the Old Man nor of his
wife. It was the voice of a small boy, its weak treble
broken by that preternatural hoarseness which only vagabondage
and the habit of premature self-assertion can give.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the face of a small boy that looked up at theirs—a
face that might have been pretty and even refined, but that
it was darkened by evil knowledge from within, and dirt
and hard experience from without.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had a blanket around his shoulders, and had evidently
just risen from his bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come in,” he repeated, “and don’t make no noise.
The Old Man’s in there talking to mar,” he continued,
pointing to an adjacent room which seemed to be a kitchen,
from which the Old Man’s voice came in deprecating
accents.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>“Let me be,” he added, querulously to Dick Bullen, who
had caught him up, blanket and all, and was affecting to
toss him into the fire; “let go o’ me, you d—d old fool,
d’ye hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus adjured, Dick Bullen lowered Johnny to the ground
with a smothered laugh, while the men, entering quietly,
ranged themselves around a long table of rough boards
which occupied the centre of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Johnny then gravely proceeded to a cupboard, and
brought out several articles which he deposited on the
table.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib348.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘NOW WADE IN, AND DON’T BE AFEARED.’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Thar’s whisky and crackers, and red herons and
cheese.” He took a bite of the latter on his way to the
table. “And sugar.” He scooped up a mouthful <i>en
route</i> with a small and very dirty hand. “And terbacker.
Thar’s dried appils too on the shelf, but I don’t admire ’em.
Appils is swellin’. Thar,” he continued; “now wade in,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>and don’t be afeared. I don’t mind the old woman. She
don’t b’long to me. S’long.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had stepped to the threshold of a small room, scarcely
larger than a closet, partitioned off from the main apartment,
and holding in its dim recess a small bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stood there a moment looking at the company, his
bare feet peeping from the blanket, and nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello, Johnny! You ain’t goin’ to turn in agin, are
ye?” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I are,” responded Johnny, decidedly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, wot’s up, old fellow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m sick.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How sick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve got a fevier. And childblains. And roomatiz,”
returned Johnny, and vanished within. After a moment’s
pause, he added in the dark, apparently from under the
bedclothes—“And biles!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was an embarrassing silence. The men looked at
each other and at the fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even with the appetising banquet before them, it seemed
as if they might again fall into the despondency of
Thompson’s grocery, when the voice of the Old Man,
incautiously lifted, came deprecatingly from the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly! Thet’s so. In course they is. A gang o’
lazy drunken loafers, and that ar Dick Bullen’s the ornariest
of all. Didn’t hev no more sabe than to come round yar
with sickness in the house and no provision. Thet’s what
I said: ‘Bullen,’ sez I, ‘it’s crazy drunk you are, or a fool,’
sez I, ‘to think o’ such a thing.’ ‘Staples,’ I sez, ‘be you a
man, Staples, and ’spect to raise h—ll under my roof and
invalids lyin’ round?’ But they would come—they would.
Thet’s wot you must ’spect o’ such trash as lays round the
Bar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A burst of laughter from the men followed this unfortunate
exposure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Whether it was overheard in the kitchen, or whether the
Old Man’s irate companion had just then exhausted all
other modes of expressing her contemptuous indignation, I
cannot say, but a back door was suddenly slammed with
great violence.</p>

<p class='c009'>A moment later and the Old Man reappeared, haply
unconscious of the cause of the late hilarious outburst, and
smiled blandly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The old woman thought she’d jest run over to Mrs.
McFadden’s for a sociable call,” he explained, with jaunty
indifference, as he took a seat at the board.</p>

<p class='c009'>Oddly enough, it needed this untoward incident to
relieve the embarrassment that was beginning to be felt by
the party, and their natural audacity returned with their
host.</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not propose to record the convivialities of that
evening. The inquisitive reader will accept the statement
that the conversation was characterised by the same
intellectual exaltation, the same cautious reverence, the
same fastidious delicacy, the same rhetorical precision, and
the same logical and coherent discourse somewhat later
in the evening, which distinguish similar gatherings of the
masculine sex in more civilised localities, and under more
favourable auspices.</p>

<p class='c009'>No glasses were broken in the absence of any; no liquor
was uselessly spilt on floor or table in the scarcity of that
article.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was nearly midnight when the festivities were interrupted.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush,” said Dick Bullen, holding up his hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the querulous voice of Johnny from his adjacent
closet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man arose hurriedly and disappeared in the
closet. Presently he reappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>“His rheumatiz is coming on agin bad,” he explained,
“and he wants rubbin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He lifted the demijohn of whisky from the table and
shook it. It was empty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick Bullen put down his tin cup with an embarrassed
laugh. So did the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man examined their contents, and said, hopefully—</p>

<p class='c009'>“I reckon that’s enough; he don’t need much. You
hold on all o’ you for a spell, and I’ll be back;” and
vanished in the closet with an old flannel shirt and the
whisky.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door closed but imperfectly, and the following
dialogue was distinctly audible:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, sonny, whar does she ache worst?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometimes over yar and sometimes under yer; but it’s
most powerful from yer to yer. Rub yer, dad.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A silence seemed to indicate a brisk rubbing. Then
Johnny—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hevin’ a good time out yer, dad?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sonny.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-morrer’s Chrismiss, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, sonny. How does she feel now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Better. Rub a little furder down. Wot’s Chrismiss,
anyway? Wot’s it all about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, it’s a day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This exhaustive definition was apparently satisfactory, for
there was a silent interval of rubbing. Presently Johnny
again—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mar sez that everywhere else but yer everybody gives
things to everybody Chrismiss, and then she just waded inter
you. She sez thar’s a man they call Sandy Claws, not a
white man, you know, but a kind o’ Chinemin, comes down
the chimbley night afore Chrismiss and gives things to
chillern—boys likes me. Puts ’em in their butes! Thet’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>what she tried to play upon me. Easy now, pop; whar are
you rubbin’ to—thet’s a mile from the place. She jest made
that up, didn’t she, jest to aggrewate me and you? Don’t
rub thar——Why, dad!”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the great quiet that seemed to have fallen upon the
house the sigh of the near pines and the drip of leaves without
was very distinct.</p>

<p class='c009'>Johnny’s voice, too, was lowered as he went on—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you take on now, fur I’m gettin’ all right fast.
Wot’s the boys doin’ out thar?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man partly opened the door and peered through.</p>

<p class='c009'>His guests were sitting there sociably enough, and there
were a few silver coins in a lean buckskin purse on the
table.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bettin’ on suthin’,—some little game or ’nother. They’re
all right,” he replied to Johnny, and recommenced his
rubbing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to take a hand and win some money,” said
Johnny, reflectively, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man glibly repeated what was evidently a familiar
formula, that if Johnny would wait until he struck it rich
in the tunnel he’d have lots of money, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Johnny, “but you don’t. And whether you
strike it or I win it, it’s about the same. It’s all luck. But
it’s mighty cur’o’s about Chrismiss—ain’t it? Why do they
call it Chrismiss?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps from some instinctive deference to the overhearing
of his guests, or from some vague sense of incongruity,
the Old Man’s reply was so low as to be inaudible beyond
the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Johnny, with some slight abatement of
interest, “I’ve heard o’ him before. Thar, that’ll do, dad.
I don’t ache near so bad as I did. Now wrap me tight in
this yer blanket. So. Now,” he added in a muffled whisper,
“sit down yer by me till I go asleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>To assure himself of obedience, he disengaged one hand
from the blanket, and grasping his father’s sleeve, again
composed himself to rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some moments the Old Man waited patiently.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the unwonted stillness of the house excited his
curiosity, and without moving from the bed, he cautiously
opened the door with his disengaged hand, and looked into
the main room.</p>

<p class='c009'>To his infinite surprise it was dark and deserted.</p>

<p class='c009'>But even then a smouldering log on the hearth broke,
and by the upspringing blaze he saw the figure of Dick
Bullen sitting by the dying embers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hello!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick started, rose, and came somewhat unsteadily
towards him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whar’s the boys?” said the Old Man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gone up the cañon on a little <i>pasear</i>. They’re coming
back for me in a minit. I’m waitin’ round for ’em. What
are you starin’ at, Old Man?” he added with a forced laugh;
“do you think I’m drunk?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man might have been pardoned the supposition,
for Dick’s eyes were humid and his face flushed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He loitered and lounged back to the chimney, yawned,
shook himself, buttoned up his coat and laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Liquor ain’t so plenty as that, Old Man. Now don’t
you git up,” he continued, as the Old Man made a movement
to release his sleeve from Johnny’s hand. “Don’
you mind manners. Sit jist whar you be; I’m goin’ in a
jiffy. Thar, that’s them now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a low tap at the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick Bullen opened it quickly, nodded “good night” to
his host, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man would have followed him but for the hand
that still unconsciously grasped his sleeve. He could have
easily disengaged it; it was small, weak, and emaciated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>But perhaps because it was small, weak, and emaciated, he
changed his mind, and drawing his chair closer to the bed,
rested his head upon it. In this defenceless attitude the
potency of his earlier potations surprised him. The room
flickered and faded before his eyes, reappeared, faded again,
went out, and left him—asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meantime, Dick Bullen, closing the door, confronted his
companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you ready?” said Staples.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ready!” said Dick; “what’s the time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Past twelve,” was the reply; “can you make it?—it’s
nigh on fifty miles, the round trip hither and yon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I reckon,” returned Dick, shortly. “Whar’s the
mare?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bill and Jack’s holdin’ her at the crossin’.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let ’em hold on a minit longer,” said Dick.</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned and re-entered the house softly.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the light of the guttering candle and dying fire he saw
that the door of the little room was open.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stepped toward it on tiptoe and looked in.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man had fallen back in his chair, snoring, his
helpless feet thrust out in a line with his collapsed shoulders,
and his hat pulled over his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Beside him, on a narrow wooden bedstead, lay Johnny,
muffled tightly in a blanket that hid all save a strip of forehead
and a few curls damp with perspiration.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick Bullen made a step forward, hesitated, and glanced
over his shoulder into the deserted room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything was quiet.</p>

<p class='c009'>With a sudden resolution he parted his huge moustaches
with both hands, and stooped over the sleeping boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But even as he did so a mischievous blast, lying in wait,
swooped down the chimney, rekindling the hearth, and lit
up the room with a shameless glow, from which Dick fled
in bashful terror.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>His companions were already waiting for him at the
crossing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two of them were struggling in the darkness with some
strange misshapen bulk, which, as Dick came nearer, took
the semblance of a great yellow horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the mare.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was not a pretty picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>From her Roman nose to her rising haunches, from her
arched spine, hidden by the stiff <i>machillas</i> of a Mexican
saddle, to her thick, straight, bony legs, there was not a line
of equine grace.</p>

<p class='c009'>In her half-blind but wholly vicious white eyes, in her
protruding under lip, in her monstrous colour, there was
nothing but ugliness and vice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now then,” said Staples, “stand cl’ar of her heels,
boys, and up with you. Don’t miss your first holt of
her mane, and mind ye get your off stirrup quick.
Ready!”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a leap, a scrambling struggle, a bound, a wild
retreat of the crowd, a circle of flying hoofs, two springless
leaps that jarred the earth, a rapid play and jingle of spurs,
a plunge, and then the voice of Dick somewhere in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t take the lower road back onless you’re hard
pushed for time! Don’t hold her in down hill! We’ll be
at the ford at five. G’lang! Hoopa! Mula! Go!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A splash, a spark struck from the ledge in the road, a
clatter in the rocky cut beyond, and Dick was gone.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>Sing, O Muse, the ride of Richard Bullen! Sing, O
Muse, of chivalrous men! the sacred quest, the doughty
deeds, the battery of low churls, the fearsome ride and
gruesome perils of the flower of Simpson’s Bar! Alack!
she is dainty, this Muse! She will have none of this bucking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>brute and swaggering, ragged rider, and I must fain
follow him, in prose, afoot!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was one o’clock; and yet he had only gained Rattlesnake
Hill. For in that time Jovita had rehearsed to him
all her imperfections and practised all her vices.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thrice had she stumbled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twice had she thrown up her Roman nose in a straight
line with the reins, and resisting bit and spur, struck out
madly across country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twice had she reared, and, rearing, fallen backward; and
twice had the agile Dick, unharmed, regained his seat before
she found her vicious legs again.</p>

<p class='c009'>And a mile beyond them, at the foot of a long hill, was
Rattlesnake Creek.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick knew that here was the crucial test of his ability to
perform his enterprise, set his teeth grimly, put his knees
well into her flanks, and changed his defensive tactics to
brisk aggression.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bullied and maddened, Jovita began the descent of the hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the artful Richard pretended to hold her in with
ostentatious objurgation and well-feigned cries of alarm.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is unnecessary to add that Jovita instantly ran away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor need I state the time made in the descent; it is
written in the chronicles of Simpson’s Bar.</p>

<p class='c009'>Enough that in another moment, as it seemed to Dick,
she was splashing on the overflowed banks of Rattlesnake
Creek.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Dick expected, the momentum she had acquired
carried her beyond the point of balking; and holding her
well together for a mighty leap, they dashed into the middle
of the swiftly-flowing current.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few moments of kicking, wading, and swimming, and
Dick drew a long breath on the opposite bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>The road from Rattlesnake Creek to Red Mountain was
tolerably level.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Either the plunge in Rattlesnake Creek had dampened
her baleful fire, or the art which led to it had shown her the
superior wickedness of her rider, for Jovita no longer wasted
her surplus energy in wanton conceits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once she bucked, but it was from force of habit; once
she shied, but it was from a new freshly-painted meeting-house
at the crossing of the county road.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hollows, ditches, gravelly deposits, patches of freshly-springing
grasses flew from beneath her rattling hoofs.</p>

<p class='c009'>She began to smell unpleasantly, once or twice she
coughed slightly, but there was no abatement of her strength
or speed.</p>

<p class='c009'>By two o’clock he had passed Red Mountain and begun
the descent to the plain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ten minutes later the driver of the fast Pioneer coach was
overtaken and passed by a “man on a Pinto hoss”—an
event sufficiently notable for remark.</p>

<p class='c009'>At half-past two Dick rose in his stirrups with a great
shout.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stars were glittering through the rifted clouds, and beyond
him, out of the plain, rose two spires, a flag-staff, and a
straggling line of black objects.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick jingled his spurs and swung his <i>riata</i>, Jovita
bounded forward, and in another moment they swept into
Tuttleville, and drew up before the wooden piazza of “The
Hotel of All Nations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>What transpired that night at Tuttleville is not strictly a
part of this record.</p>

<p class='c009'>Briefly I may state, however, that after Jovita had been
handed over to a sleepy hostler, whom she at once kicked
into unpleasant consciousness, Dick sallied out with the bar-keeper
for a tour of the sleeping town.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lights still gleamed from a few saloons and gambling-houses;
but, avoiding these, they stopped before several
closed shops, and by persistent tapping and judicious outcry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>roused the proprietors from their beds, and made them
unbar the doors of their magazines and expose their
wares.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sometimes they were met by curses, but oftener by
interest and some concern in their needs, and the interview
was invariably concluded by a drink.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was three o’clock before this pleasantry was given over,
and with a small water-proof bag of india-rubber strapped
on his shoulders, Dick returned to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c009'>But here he was waylaid by Beauty—Beauty opulent in
charms, affluent in dress, persuasive in speech, and Spanish
in accent!</p>

<p class='c009'>In vain she repeated the invitation in “Excelsior,” happily
scorned by all Alpine-climbing youth, and rejected by this
child of the Sierras—a rejection softened in this instance by
a laugh and his last gold coin.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then he sprang to the saddle and dashed down the
lonely street and out into the lonelier plain, where presently
the lights, the black line of houses, the spires and the flag-staff
sank into the earth behind him again and were lost in
the distance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The storm had cleared away, the air was brisk and cold,
the outlines of adjacent landmarks were distinct, but it was
half-past four before Dick reached the meeting-house and
the crossing of the country road.</p>

<p class='c009'>To avoid the rising grade he had taken a longer and more
circuitous road, in whose viscid mud Jovita sank fetlock
deep at every bound.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a poor preparation for a steady ascent of five miles
more; but Jovita, gathering her legs under her, took it with
her usual blind, unreasoning fury, and a half-hour later
reached the long level that led to Rattlesnake Creek.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another half-hour would bring him to the creek.</p>

<p class='c009'>He threw the reins lightly upon the neck of the mare,
chirruped to her and began to sing.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>Suddenly Jovita shied with a bound that would have
unseated a less practised rider.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hanging to her rein was a figure that had leaped from
the bank, and at the same time from the road before her
arose a shadowy horse and rider.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Throw up your hands,” commanded this second apparition
with an oath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick felt the mare tremble, quiver, and apparently sink
under him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He knew what it meant, and was prepared.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stand aside, Jack Simpson, I know you, you d—d thief.
Let me pass, or——”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not finish the sentence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Jovita rose straight in the air with a terrific bound,
throwing the figure from her bit with a single shake of her
vicious head, and charged her deadly malevolence down on
the impediment before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>An oath, a pistol-shot, horse and highwayman rolled over
in the road, and the next moment Jovita was a hundred
yards away.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the good right arm of her rider, shattered by a bullet,
dropped helplessly at his side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without slackening his speed he shifted the reins to his
left hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>But a few moments later he was obliged to halt and
tighten the saddle-girths that had slipped in the onset.</p>

<p class='c009'>This in his crippled condition took some time.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had no fear of pursuit, but looking up he saw that the
eastern stars were already paling, and that the distant peaks
had lost their ghostly whiteness, and now stood out blackly
against a lighter sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Day was upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then completely absorbed in a single idea, he forgot the
pain of his wound, and mounting again dashed on towards
Rattlesnake Creek.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>But now Jovita’s breath came broken by gasps, Dick
reeled in his saddle, and brighter and brighter grew the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ride, Richard; run, Jovita; linger, O day!</p>

<p class='c009'>For the last few rods there was a roaring in his ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Was it exhaustion from loss of blood, or what?</p>

<p class='c009'>He was dazed and giddy as he swept down the hill, and
did not recognise his surroundings.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had he taken the wrong road, or was this Rattlesnake
Creek?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“WAS THIS RATTLESNAKE CREEK?”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the brawling creek he had swum a few hours before
had risen, more than doubled its volume, and now rolled a
swift and resistless river between him and Rattlesnake
Hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the first time that night Richard’s heart sank within
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The river, the mountain, the quickening east swam before
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>He shut them to recover his self-control.</p>

<p class='c009'>In that brief interval, by some fantastic mental process,
the little room at Simpson’s Bar, and the figures of the
sleeping father and son, rose upon him.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened his eyes widely, cast off his coat, pistol, boots,
and saddle, bound his precious pack tightly to his shoulders,
grasped the bare flanks of Jovita with his bared knees, and,
with a shout, dashed into the yellow water.</p>

<p class='c009'>A cry rose from the opposite bank as the head of a man
and horse struggled for a few moments against the battling
current, and then were swept away, amid uprooted trees and
whirling driftwood.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>The Old Man started and awoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fire on the hearth was dead, the candle in the outer
room flickering in its socket, and somebody was rapping at
the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>He opened it, but fell back with a cry before the dripping
half-naked figure that reeled against the door-post.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dick?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush! Is he awake yet?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,—but Dick——?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dry up, you old fool! Get me some whisky <i>quick</i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man flew and returned with—an empty
bottle!</p>

<p class='c009'>Dick would have sworn, but his strength was not equal to
the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>He staggered, caught at the handle of the door, and
motioned to the Old Man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thar’s suthin’ in my pack yer for Johnny. Take it off.
I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man unstrapped the pack and laid it before the
exhausted man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Open it, quick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did so with trembling fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>It contained only a few poor toys—cheap and barbaric
enough, goodness knows, but bright with paint and tinsel.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of them was broken; another, I fear, was irretrievably
ruined by water; and on the other, ah me! there was a
cruel spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It don’t look like much, that’s a fact,” said Dick ruefully....
“But it’s the best we could do.... Take ’em,
Old Man, and put ’em in his stocking, and tell him—tell
him, you know—hold me, Old Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Man caught at his sinking figure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell him,” said Dick, with a weak little laugh—“tell
him Sandy Claus has come.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And even so, bedraggled, ragged, unshaven and unshorn,
with one arm hanging helplessly at his side, Santa Claus
came to Simpson’s Bar and fell fainting on the first
threshold.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Christmas dawn came slowly after, touching the
remoter peaks with the rosy warmth of ineffable love.</p>

<p class='c009'>And it looked so tenderly on Simpson’s Bar that the
whole mountain, as it caught in a generous action, blushed
to the skies.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE BREACH OF PROMISE CASE.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>AMOS DIXON had not been long gone from the elegant
house when Miss Sophia Garr, caparisoned in a
jaunty hat and a ready-made cloak, sallied forth on a
little business of her own.</p>

<p class='c009'>She took the nearest way to Montgomery Street, and
proceeded almost to the head of that thoroughfare.
Ascending a very wide flight of steps, she turned to the
right, and went up a narrower flight; turning again to
the left, she went up a narrower flight still. Without
pausing to take breath, Miss Sophia proceeded, by the help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>of the skylight, to read the names on a whole army of
doors. Making nearly the whole circuit of the long hall,
she arrived finally at a door which seemed to meet with
her approval, for she nodded her head, knocked, and
walked briskly in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a horrid-looking man!” she said, as she threw
herself upon a well-worn lounge, and breathed heavily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an ugly old vixen!” replied the gentleman thus
apostrophised, looking up from the desk at which he sat
writing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hem!” rejoined Miss Sophia, eyeing him wickedly,
and still labouring for her breath, after her unwonted
exertion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, madam?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How dare you, sir—but this is Mr. Beanson, no
doubt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I called, sir,” pronounced Miss Garr, in an angry tone,
“to have you explain to me explicitly, and without reservation,
what constitutes a breach of promise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now two different persons had been harassing Mr.
Beanson that very morning with unpaid bills. Yet it
was a characteristic of this remarkable man that all his
greatest troubles were in the future—that undiscovered
country of his first brief, and the presidency. He was
possessed of a wonderful talent at apprehending evil; and
he had not heard Miss Sophia this long without exerting
it. He thought instantly of the snares laid for unsuspecting
young men by designing females, and did not grow calmer
as his visitor repeated—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, sir; you profess to be a lawyer, if you are not.
Can you tell me, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“M—madam, I don’t know you!” exclaimed Mr. Beanson,
feeling very much confused, but looking, as he always
did, very aggressive.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>“I found your card in my card-case, and I want to know,
sir, what constitutes a breach of promise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madam, I tell you I don’t know you <i>at all</i>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But did you not leave your card in my card-case at
Mrs. Clayton’s?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I did, madam, but that does not constitute a breach of
promise; and I warn you now,” said Mr. Beanson, raising
his voice and his forefinger, and shaking both at her simultaneously,
“I warn you now, madam, that you cannot
ground an action for breach of promise on a little skilful
advertising!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Beanson observed a sudden and marked change
coming over the features of his visitor, and took it for
the herald of her discomfiture and his own triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do I mean?” iterated Mr. Beanson. “I mean,
madam, that in this latter stage of juridical enlightenment
a man cannot be held for breach of promise, or prosecuted
for breach of promise, by a woman whom he never saw before
in his life—and, for that matter, never wishes to see again—just
because he put his business card in her card-case.”
Here the speaker, seeing the remarkable effect of his
philippic, launched himself upon his feet, the better to
enjoy the ovation he was preparing for himself. As he
undoubled his exceeding length before Sophia, he had
the satisfaction of seeing the additional effect he was producing,
even apart from his oratory. It was the very yellow
jaundice of tones in which Mr. Beanson concluded—</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, madam, you would not get any intelligent court in
the land, in these premises, to find cause of action. It
was nothing but a skilful advertisement—in short, an act of
commercial and legal genius. You, I suppose, would make
it a crime punishable by marriage with such as you. The
thing is simply ridiculous! Madam, I have done. Have
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Mr. Beanson resumed his seat triumphantly, and eyed
the astonished Garr with an expression that made his head
look older than common.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Sophia could not have interrupted the foregoing
forensic display if she had tried. In her bewilderment
she was mutely deciding whether she, Sophia Garr, or all
the men were going stark mad. George Lang had offered
himself to Amelia, after being accepted by herself. Then
this impudent red-headed wretch—whom she had never
attempted to marry—either he or she was certainly crazy.
The question was too complicated for a prompt decision.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two had sat for some moments, glaring at each other,
in profound silence, when Miss Garr suddenly exclaimed,
“You long-waisted vagabond, shut up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This might have been effectual in a contest with a person
of her own sex; since it might have shocked into silence
or proved an <i>Ultima Thule</i> of feminine virulence. When,
however, Mr. Beanson, having taken some time to consider,
remembered that he was not talking at all when he was
requested to “shut up,” the thing struck him as laughable.
Accordingly Mr. Beanson laughed—laughed loud and long,
till Mr. Beanson had laughed out all the fun there was in
the occurrence, and some of his own anger to boot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, madam,” said he facetiously, “I am prepared to
part with you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Garr was more angry than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, madam, I am prepared to part with you. I will
not detain you further.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You ugly, hateful, impudent wretch!” remarked Sophia,
finding speech at last. “You may insult me here as much
as you please, since I am without a protector; but you shall
not drive me away till you have answered my question. I
would as soon marry a keg of nails as you, sir; so you may
set your mind at rest! It is somebody else that my outraged
feelings are interested in—somebody else of more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>consequence than you, though I verily believe he is as big
a villain——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” exclaimed Mr. Beanson, as any other drowning
man might have done before he was swallowed up by any
other flood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you suppose, sir, I would walk all the way here
from Folsome Street, and up these interminable stairs, and
then go away, without knowing what constitutes a breach of
promise? I would have you know, sir, that my case is
urgent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you did not intend to prosecute me at all?”
asked Mr. Beanson, opening his eyes very wide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have I not told you once? Would I prosecute a keg
of nails, you ninny?”</p>

<p class='c009'>As strange as it may seem, a bland smile, which spread
over the entire face of Mr. Beanson, was the result of this
last poisoned arrow of Miss Garr. The <i>ignis fatuus</i> of his
first brief was again rising over the marshes of his present
embarrassments. “Well, well, madam,” rejoined Mr.
Beanson, “I will do anything in the world to serve you.
Who is it, by the way, that you wish to prosecute?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know as that is any of your business at present,
sir; I first want an answer to the question I have asked
about forty times: What constitutes a breach of promise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To tell the truth, madam, there are so many conditions
to a breach of promise that an abstract definition of it
would not do the least good in the world; and I could
not give one without consulting my books—but do you
absolutely insist on mentioning no names?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will you state the case, then, without names?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must see, sir, that my natural delicacy revolts
against any revelations to strangers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, madam, counsellor and client should never be
strangers. Besides, you must be aware that a breach of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>promise depends on so many things. As I have said
before, there are so many conditions that we cannot
proceed at all unless you answer certain questions; such
as, for instance, whether you—I mean the lady, the plaintiff,
in fact—has any proof of a promise, express or implied.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Garr looked about the room in silent uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you—I mean, has the lady—for example, any
witnesses—any one who has heard the defendant that is to
be,” pursued Mr. Beanson, in the language of the future,
“express or imply a promise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She could not say that the lady had.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Had she any letters to show which contained a promise
either expressed or implied?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The lady,” responded Miss Garr mysteriously; “the
lady has not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has the plaintiff been injured in any way by the
defendant?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, grossly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, then, I begin to see a case. Set the damages
heavy—set the damages heavy. By-the-bye, is the defendant
rich?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good,” said Mr. Beanson, rubbing his hands. “We
will make the villain suffer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, Mr. Beanson. Fifty thousand dollars will
be little enough. Thank you, Mr. Beanson.” And Miss
Garr actually shook hands with Mr. Beanson on the spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hem, ah! what was—the—nature of—these injuries—that
you say the defendant had inflicted upon you—the
lady, I should say, the plaintiff?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Garr feigned an uneasy look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Must I tell?” she demanded, dropping her eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry, madam, it is absolutely necessary, since the
whole case seems to hang upon that injury, or those injuries
alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>“Well, then,” said Sophia, riveting her maidenly orbs
meekly upon a broken coal-scuttle; “well, then, sir, he
kissed her in the dark!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that all?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it not enough, sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might have been enough,” replied Mr. Beanson, in
the stumbling innocence which had been the bane of his
life; “it might have been enough, madam, for the
defendant, or for the plaintiff even, but it is hardly
enough to ground an action of breach of promise upon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Garr was angry; Mr. Beanson puzzled; and both
were silent. If he had seen a possible chance of securing
his first brief in any other way, Mr. Archibald Beanson
would most certainly have dismissed Sophia instanter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Running his long fingers inanely through his red hair,
“Madam!” he said at last, “I think I shall be obliged to
consult Bishop on Marriage.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now look here, sir,” observed Miss Sophia, wrapping
her ready-made cloak tighter around her, “if you keep on,
I shall lose my patience and my good manners. Who in
the world wants to consult the bishop on marriage? An
ordinary minister, or even a justice of the peace, will do
me. I am not proud, sir.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Beanson, trying to look learned, succeeded in looking
confused. Undoubling himself again—this time with
abstruse deliberation—he went to a meagre bookcase, and
returned to his desk. “It was this book,” said he, “that
I had reference to—‘Bishop on Marriage and Divorce!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now you begin to get sensible,” remarked Miss
Garr, in a tone and manner which, expressed in words,
would have read, “I grant your pardon, sir, for your
trivial mistake about ministers and bishops.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Beanson opened the book, and, glancing over the
table of contents, his eye rested on the heading of a
chapter, which read thus—“Want of age.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>In his utter helplessness, Archibald looked up again
at Sophia and asked, “Is there any want of age in the
parties?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now look here, sir; I did not come here to be
insulted. You think I do not understand your irony. I
would have you to know that I do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I asked that question,” said Mr. Beanson, soothingly,
“with all due reverence for your age. This is the first
time you have openly acknowledged that you are the
plaintiff in the contemplated suit. I have known it all
along, however; and I therefore assure you that the
question about age was suggested wholly by my ignorance
as to the other party—the defendant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Beanson, without perusing the commentary on this
speech written in the face of his client, now glanced his
eye back to the table of contents again. The question
suggested this time seemed to that astute pundit an
honest one, and based on sufficient grounds. “Want
of mental capacity,” he read. “That’s it,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There may be a want of mental capacity in one of the
parties. Do you think the defence would make that out?”
inquired Mr. Beanson.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might be,” replied Miss Garr, still pursuing the
thought into which she had been drifted, and in which she
had gradually drowned some of her indignation at the
unsuspecting Archibald. Lang’s late conduct may have
been dictated by insanity—proposing to Amelia after
engaging himself to her, Sophia Garr! “Really, Mr.
Beanson, it might be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, madam? Then we must guard against that!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The client looked inquiringly at the lawyer, who was for
a moment wrapped in a mute study. “Can the defence,
madam,” demanded Mr. Beanson at last, “can—can they
prove that you have ever been in Stockton, or any private
insane asylum?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>Here the reader who has visited the Sandwich Islands
may pause to congratulate himself. Remembering the
crater of Mauna Loa, he will have a more vivid idea of Miss
Garr’s feelings than anything but that molten sea of lava
could possibly suggest. Sophia jumped indignantly to
her feet, and poured a tide of epithets, so seething-hot,
over the head of the astonished Archibald, that for a
moment he succumbed before it, blank and still as some
patriarchal porpoise, lava-cooked and cast upon the beach
of Hawaii.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/ib370.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘YOU WRETCH!’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“You wretch!” was the comparatively calm peroration
of Miss Garr, “you—you horrid wretch! I have a mind
to sue you for slander. How dare you put such a stigma
on my character when you know, or ought to know, that
George Lang is the one that is insane!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, ah! George Lang, my employer?” exclaimed Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Beanson, coming to life. “That’s the gentleman you
would prosecute. Well, now!”</p>

<p class='c009'>To the intense astonishment of Archibald an increasing
bitterness of manner succeeded, and he said, “If you are
not insane, madam, you are certainly in your dotage.
Why, look at this desk, here! Every one of these papers
is a deed made out by order of the gentleman you would
rob. Go along with your breach of promise! The court
would send you to an asylum as sure as guns!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Beanson’s face grew brighter as his indignation grew,
and his entire head was girt about with an unwonted
appearance of youth. Sophia’s rough handling, like sandpaper
upon an antique bust, had rubbed some of the yellow
mould away—had lifted that mysterious veil woven by the
semblance of years, and had opened up to her eyes and
ours, the perfect glories of Mr. Beanson’s Golden Age.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You came here, no doubt, madam,” continued Archibald,
with no such interruption as the foregoing paragraph;
“in fact, I feel sure, madam, you came here to prevail on
me to enter into a plot against my only present employer,
and may be (here Mr. Beanson was very bitter in the curl
of his lip and his general tone), may be?—no, I am sure,
too, that you would attempt to marry me at last, as a meet
punishment for being your accomplice. Oh! I see it in
your eye, madam; you need not deny it!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Garr, at one time or another, since she had read
Mr. Beanson’s name on his card, might have thought
vaguely of “prospecting” him for a husband, in case of the
failure of all other claims; but to do her justice, it was
only ineffable rage that Archibald saw in her eye, as he
repeated—though Sophia had not attempted to speak—“You
need not deny it, for I tell you I see it in your eye!
and as for Mr. Lang, I am doing his notary business, and a
great deal of it, too, especially of late. He is selling hosts
of property—hosts of property, madam, in the name and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>with the written consent of the Claytons. Why, the very
heaviest sale is to be made to-day. Now what does this
mutual confidence presuppose? Madam,” said Mr. Beanson,
rising and assuming an air of mock politeness, “if you
were as sure that you are sane, as I am that he is going to
marry the daughter of Mrs. Clayton, you would not have
taken up so much of my valuable time from Mr. Lang’s
business. But, madam, this is the door,” concluded Mr.
Beanson with an urbane wave of the hand, as he resumed
his seat and began silently to arrange the papers before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Miss Sophia, white with rage, did not stir or speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>Involuntarily the hands of Mr. Beanson paused in the
labours they had undertaken, and fell heavily, one on each
side of his chair, almost to the floor. As he sat and gazed
at the still shape before him, the idea of the ghost in
<i>Hamlet</i> was suddenly suggested to the fertile mind of Mr.
Beanson. This was not a remarkable conception, taken
apart from its consequences; yet Mr. Beanson, forgetting
the matter of gender, not only congratulated himself on the
aptness of the allusion, though not expressed in words, but
actually chuckled, and at last, laughed outright, as an
encouragement to his own genius.</p>

<p class='c009'>Had it not been for this fatal laugh, Miss Garr could
have spoken, and her speech might have been terrible. But
something came perversely up into her throat. Turning
briskly upon her heel, she darted through the door to be in
advance of her own tears; and she and the first brief of
Mr. Archibald Beanson disappeared together.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>THE DUKE OF BRIDGEWATER.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>ONE of these fellows was about seventy, or upwards, and
had a bald head and very grey whiskers. He had
an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy blue woollen
shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his
boot-tops, and home-knit galluses—no, he only had one.
He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat, with slick brass
buttons, flung over his arm, and both of them had big, fat,
ratty-looking carpet-bags.</p>
<p class='c009'>The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as
ornery. After breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the
first thing that come out was that these chaps didn’t know
one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What got you into trouble?” says the bald-head to
t’other chap.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>“Well, I’d been selling an article to take the tartar off
the teeth—and it does take it off, too, and generly the
enamel along with it—but I stayed about one night longer
than I ought to, and was just in the act of sliding out when
I ran across you on the trail this side of town, and you told
me they were coming, and begged me to help you to get
off. So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and
would scatter out <i>with</i> you. That’s the whole yarn—what’s
yourn?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I’d ben a-runnin’ a little temperance revival
thar, ’bout a week, and was the pet of the women-folks, big
and little, for I was makin’ it mighty warm for the rummies,
I <i>tell</i> you, and takin’ as much as five or six dollars a night—ten
cents a head, children and niggers free—and business
a growin’ all the time; when somehow or another a little
report got around, last night, that I had a way of puttin’ in
my time with a private jug, on the sly. A nigger rousted
me out this mornin’, and told me the people was getherin’
on the quiet, with their dogs and horses, and they’d be
along pretty soon and give me ’bout half-an-hour’s start,
and then run me down, if they could; and if they got me
they’d tar and feather me, and ride me on a rail, sure. I
didn’t wait for no breakfast—I warn’t hungry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old man,” says the young one, “I reckon we might
double-team it together; what do you think?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I ain’t undisposed. What’s your line—mainly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jour printer, by trade; do a little in patent medicines;
theatre-actor—tragedy, you know; take a turn at mesmerism
and phrenology when there’s a chance; teach
singing geography school for a change; sling a lecture,
sometimes—oh, I do lots of things—most anything that
comes handy, so it ain’t work. What’s your lay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time.
Layin’ on o’ hands is my best holt—for cancer, and
paralysis, and sich things; and I k’n tell a fortune pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>good, when I’ve got somebody along to find out the facts
for me. Preachin’s my line, too; and workin’ camp meetin’s;
and missionaryin’ around.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young
man hove a sigh and says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alas!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’re you alassin’ about?” says the bald-head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To think I should have lived to be leading such a life,
and be degraded down into such company.” And he
begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dern your skin, ain’t the company good enough for
you?” says the bald-head, pretty pert and uppish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it <i>is</i> good enough for me; it’s as good as I
deserve; for who fetched me so low, when I was so high?
<i>I</i> did myself. I don’t blame <i>you</i>, gentlemen—far from it;
I don’t blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold
world do its worst; one thing I know—there’s a grave
somewhere for me. The world may go on just as it’s
always done, and take everything from me—loved ones,
property, everything—but it can’t take that. Some day I’ll
lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken heart
will be at rest.” He went on a-wiping.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Drot your pore broken heart,” says the bald-head;
“what are you heaving your pore broken heart at <i>us</i> f’r?
<i>We</i> hain’t done nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I know you haven’t. I ain’t blaming you, gentlemen.
I brought myself down—yes, I did it myself. It’s
right I should suffer—perfectly right—I don’t make any
moan.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought
down from?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, you would not believe me; the world never
believes—let it pass—’tis no matter. The secret of my
birth——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The secret of your birth? Do you mean to say——”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>“Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will
reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you.
By rights I am a duke!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon
mine did, too. Then the bald-head says: “No! you can’t
mean it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of
Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last
century, to breathe the pure air of freedom; married here,
and died, leaving a son, his own father dying about the
same time. The second son of the late duke seized the
title and estates—the infant real duke was ignored. I am
the lineal descendant of that infant—I am the rightful
Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from
my high estate, hunted of men, despised by the cold world,
ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companionship
of felons on a raft!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to
comfort him, but he said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be
much comforted; said if we was a mind to acknowledge
him, that would do him more good than most anything else;
so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said we
ought to bow, when we spoke to him, and say, “Your
Grace,” or “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”—and he
wouldn’t mind it if we called him plain “Bridgewater,”
which he said was a title, anyway, and not a name; and
one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little
thing for him he wanted done.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through
dinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says,
“Will yo’ Grace have some o’ dis, or some o’ dat?” and
so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the old man got pretty silent, by-and-by—didn’t
have much to say, and didn’t look pretty comfortable over
all that petting that was going on around that duke. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>seemed to have something on his mind. So, along in the
afternoon, he says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation sorry
for you, but you ain’t the only person that’s had troubles
like that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you ain’t. You ain’t the only person that’s ben
snaked down wrongfully out’n a high place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alas!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of his
birth.” And by jings, <i>he</i> begins to cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hold! What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still
sort of sobbing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To the bitter death!” He took the old man by the
hand and squeezed it, and says, “The secret of your being:
speak!”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘BILGEWATER, I AM THE LATE DAUPHIN!’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>You bet you Jim and me stared, this time. Then the
duke says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, my friend, it is too true—your eyes is lookin’
at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin,
Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry
Antonette.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You! At your age! No! You mean you’re the late
Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old,
at the very least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it;
trouble has brung these grey hairs and this premature
balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue
jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled, trampled-on, and
sufferin’ rightful King of France.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Well, he cried and took on so, that me and Jim didn’t
know hardly what to do, we was so sorry—and so glad and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>proud we’d got him with us, too. So we set in, like we
done before with the duke, and tried to comfort <i>him</i>. But
he said it warn’t no use, nothing but to be dead and done
with it all could do him
any good; though he
said it often made him
feel easier and better for
a while if people treated
him according to his
rights, and got down on
one knee to speak to
him, and always called
him “Your Majesty,”
and waited on him first
at meals, and didn’t set
down in his presence
till he asked them. So
Jim and me set to
majestying him, and
doing this and that and
t’other for him, and
standing up till he told
us we might set down.
This done him heaps of
good, and so he got
cheerful and comfortable.
But the duke
kind of soured on him,
and didn’t look a bit
satisfied with the way
things was going; still,
the king acted real
friendly towards him,
and said the duke’s
great-grandfather and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought
of by <i>his</i> father, and was allowed to come to the palace
considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till
by-and-by the king says—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time,
on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your
bein’ sour? It’ll only make things oncomfortable. It ain’t
my fault I warn’t born a duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t
born a king—so what’s the use to worry? Make the best
o’ things the way you find ’em, says I—that’s my motto.
This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here—plenty grub
and an easy life—come, give us your hand, Duke, and less
all be friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to
see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness, and we
felt mighty good over it, because it would a been a miserable
business to have any unfriendliness on the raft; for
what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody
to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.</p>

<p class='c009'>It didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these
liars warn’t no kings nor dukes, at all, but just low-down
humbugs and frauds. But I never said nothing, never let
on; kept it to myself; it’s the best way; then you don’t
have no quarrels, and don’t get into no trouble. If they
wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn’t no objections,
‘long as it would keep peace in the family; and it
warn’t no use to tell Jim, so I didn’t tell him. If I never
learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to
get along with his kind of people is to let them have their
own way.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>IT is now goin on 2 (too) yeres, as I very well remember,
since I crossed the Planes for Kaliforny, the Brite land
of Jold. While crossin the Planes all so bold I fell in
with sum noble red men of the forest (N.B. This is rote
Sarcastical. Injins is Pizin, whar ever found), which thay

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>I arrove at Salt Lake in doo time. At Camp Scott there
was a lot of U.S. sojers, hosstensibly sent out thare to smash
the mormins but really to eat Salt vittles &amp; play poker
&amp; other beautiful but sumwhat onsartin games. I got
acquainted with sum of the officers. Thay lookt putty
scrumpshus in their Bloo coats with brass buttings onto
um &amp; ware very talented drinkers, but so fur as fitin is
consarned I’d willingly put my wax figgers agin the hull
party.</p>

<p class='c009'>My desire was to exhibit my grate show in Salt Lake
City, so I called on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull amung
the mormins, and axed his permishun to pitch my tent and
onfurl my banner to the gintle breezis. He lookt at me in
a austeer manner for a few minits, and sed—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you bleeve in Solomon, Saint Paul, the immaculateness
of the Mormin Church and the Latter-day
Revelashuns?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sez I, “I’m on it!” I make it a pint to git along
plesunt, tho I didn’t know what under the Son the old
feller was drivin at. He sed I mite show.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?” sez I,
preparin to rite him som free parsis.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hev eighty wives, Mister Ward. I sertinly am
marrid.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you like it as far as you hev got?” sed I.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sed “middlin,” and axed me wouldn’t I like to see
his famerly, to which I replide that I wouldn’t mind minglin
with the fair Seck &amp; Barskin in the winnin smiles of his
interestin wives. He accordingly tuk me to his Scareum.
The house is powerful big &amp; in an exceedin large room
was his wives and children, which larst was squawkin
and hollerin enuff to take the roof rite orf the house.
The wimin was of all sizes and ages. Sum was pretty
&amp; sum was plane—sum was helthy and sum was on the
Wayne—which is verses, tho sich was not my intentions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>as I don’t ’prove of puttin verses in Proze rittins, tho ef
occashun requires I can jerk a Poim ekal to any of them
Atlantic Munthly fellers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My wives, Mister Ward,” sed Yung.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your sarvant, marms,” sed I, as I sot down in a cheer
which a red-heded female brawt me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Besides these wives you see here, Mister Ward,” sed
Yung, “I hav eighty more in varis parts of this consecrated
land which air Sealed to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which,” sez I, gittin up &amp; starin at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sealed, Sir! sealed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whare bowts?” sez I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I sed, Sir, that they was sealed!” He spoke in a
traggerdy voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will they probly continner on in that stile to any great
extent, Sir,” I axed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sir,” sed he, turnin as red as a biled beet, “don’t you
know that the rules of our Church is that I, the Profit, may
hev as meny wives as I wants?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Jes so,” I sed. “You are old pie, ain’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Them as is Sealed to me—that is to say, to be mine
when I wants um—air at present my sperretooul wives,”
sed Mister Yung.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Long may thay wave!” sez I, seein I shood git into a
scrape ef I didn’t look out.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a privit conversashun with Brigham I learnt the
follerin fax:—It takes him six weeks to kiss his wives.
He don’t do it only onct a yere, &amp; sez it is wuss
nor cleanin house. He don’t pretend to know his
children, thare is so many of um, tho they all know
him. He sez about every child he meats call him Par,
and he takes it for grantid it is so. His wives air very
expensive. They allers want suthin &amp; ef he don’t buy it
for um they set the house in a uproar. He sez he don’t
have a minit’s peace. His wives fite amung theirselves so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>much that he has bilt a fitin room for thare speshul benefit,
&amp; when too of em get into a row he has em turned loose
into that place, whare the dispoot is settled a cordin to
the rules of the London prize ring. Sumtimes thay abooz
hisself individooally. Thay hev pulled the most of his hair
out at the roots &amp; he wares meny a horrible scar upon his
body, inflicted with mop-handles, broomsticks and sich.
Occashunly they git mad &amp; scald him with bilin hot water.
When he got eny waze cranky thay’d shut him up in a dark
closit, previsly whippin him arter the stile of muthers when
thare orfsprings git onruly. Sumtimes when he went in
swimmin thay’d go to the banks of the Lake and steal
all his close, thereby compellin him to sneek home by a
sircootius rowt, drest in the Skanderlus stile of the Greek
Slaiv. “I find that the keers of a marrid life way hevy
onto me,” sed the Profit, “&amp; sumtimes I wish I’d remained
singel.” I left the Profit and startid for the tavern whare I
put up to. On my way I was overtuk by a lurge krowd of
Mormons, which they surrounded me &amp; statid that they
were goin into the Show free.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wall,” sez I, “ef I find a individooal who is goin’ round
lettin folks into his show free, I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’ve had a Revelashun biddin us go into A. Ward’s
Show without payin nothin!” thay showtid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” hollered a lot of femaile Mormonesses, ceasin me
by the cote tales &amp; swingin me round very rapid, “we’re all
goin in free! So sez the Revelashun!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s Old Revelashun got to do with my show?” sez
I, gittin putty rily. “Tell Mister Revelashun,” sed I,
drawin myself up to my full hite and lookin round upon the
ornery krowd with a prowd &amp; defiant mean, “tell Mister
Revelashun to mind his own bizness, subject only to the
Konstitushun of the United States!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh now let us in, that’s a sweet man,” sed several
femailes, puttin thare arms rownd me in lovin stile.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>“Becum 1 of us. Becum a Preest &amp; hav wives Sealed to
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not a Seal!” sez I, startin back in horror at the idee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh stay, Sir, stay,” sed a tall gawnt femaile, ore whoos
hed 37 summirs must hev parsd, “stay, &amp; I’ll be your
Jentle Gazelle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not ef I know it, you won’t,” sez I. “Awa, you
skanderlus femaile, awa! Go &amp; be a Nunnery!” That’s
what I sed, jes so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“&amp; I,” sed a fat chunky femaile, who must hev wade
more than too hundred lbs., “I will be your sweet gidin
Star!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Sez I, “Ile bet two dollers and a half you won’t!”
Whare ear I may Rome Ile still be troo 2 thee, Oh Betsy
Jane! [N.B. Betsy Jane is my wife’s Sir naime.]</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wiltist thou not tarry hear in the Promist Land?” sed
several of the miserabil critters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ile see you all essenshally cussed be 4 I wiltist!”
roared I, as mad as I cood be at thare infernul noncents.
I girded up my Lions &amp; fled the Seen. I packt up my
duds &amp; left Salt Lake, which is a 2nd Soddum and
Germorrer, inhabitid by as theavin &amp; onprincipled a set of
retchis as ever drew Breth in any spot on the Globe.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><i>KITTY ANSWERS.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>IT was dimmest twilight when Kitty entered Mrs. Ellison’s
room, and sank down on the first chair in silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Colonel met a friend at the St. Louis, and forgot
about the expedition, Kitty,” said Fanny, “and he only
came in half-an-hour ago. But it’s just as well; I know
you’ve had a splendid time. Where’s Mr. Arbuton?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kitty burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, has anything happened to him?” cried Mrs.
Ellison, springing towards her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To him? No! What should happen to <i>him</i>?” Kitty
demanded, with an indignant accent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, has anything happened to <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know if you can call it <i>happening</i>. But I
suppose you’ll be satisfied now, Fanny. He’s offered himself
to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kitty uttered the last words with a sort of violence, as if,
since the fact must be stated, she wished it to appear in the
sharpest relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” said Mrs. Ellison, not so well satisfied as
the successful match-maker ought to be. So long as it was
a marriage in the abstract, she had never ceased to desire
it; but as the actual union of Kitty and this Mr. Arbuton,
of whom, really, they knew so little, and of whom, if she
searched her heart, she had as little liking as knowledge, it
was another affair. Mrs. Ellison trembled at her triumph,
and began to think that failure would have been easier to
bear. Were they in the least suited to each other? Would
she like to see poor Kitty chained for life to that impassive
egotist, whose very merits were repellent, and whose
modesty even seemed to convict and snub you? Mrs.
Ellison was not able to put the matter to herself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>moderation, either way; doubtless she did Mr. Arbuton
injustice now.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you accept him?” she whispered feebly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Accept him?” repeated Kitty. “No!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, dear!” again sighed Mrs. Ellison, feeling that this
was scarcely better, and not daring to ask further.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m dreadfully perplexed, Fanny,” said Kitty, after
waiting for the questions which did not come, “and I wish
you’d help me think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will, darling. But I don’t know that I’ll be of much
use. I begin to think I’m not very good at thinking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kitty, who longed chiefly to get the situation more distinctly
before herself, gave no heed to this confession, but
went on to rehearse the whole affair. The twilight lent her
its veil; and in the kindly obscurity she gathered courage
to face all the facts, and even to find what was droll in
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was very solemn, of course, and I was frightened;
but I tried to keep my wits about me, and <i>not</i> to say yes,
simply because that was the easiest thing. I told him that
I didn’t know,—and I don’t; and that I must have time to
think,—and I must. He was very ungenerous, and said he
had hoped I had already had time to think; and he couldn’t
seem to understand, or else I couldn’t very well explain,
how it had been with me all along.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He might certainly say you had encouraged him,” Mrs.
Ellison remarked, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Encouraged him, Fanny? How can you accuse me of
such indelicacy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Encouraging isn’t indelicacy. The gentlemen <i>have</i> to
be encouraged, or of course they’d never have any courage.
They’re so timid, naturally.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t think Mr. Arbuton is very timid. He seemed
to think that he had only to ask as a matter of form, and I
had no business to say anything. What has he ever done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>for me? And hasn’t he often been intensely disagreeable?
He oughtn’t to have spoken just after overhearing what he
did. It was horrid to do so. He was very obtuse, too,
not to see that girls can’t always be so certain of themselves
as men, or, if they are, don’t know they are as soon
as they’re asked.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” interrupted Mrs. Ellison, “that’s the way with
girls. I do believe that most of them—when they’re young
like you, Kitty—never think of marriage as the end of their
flirtations. They’d just like the attentions and the romance
to go on for ever, and never turn into anything more
serious; and they’re not to blame for that, though they <i>do</i>
get blamed for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly,” assented Kitty eagerly, “that’s it; that’s just
what I was saying; that’s the very reason why girls must
have time to make up their minds. <i>You</i> had, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, two minutes. Poor Dick was going back to his
regiment, and stood with his watch in his hand. I said no,
and called after him to correct myself. But, Kitty, if the
romance had happened to stop without his saying anything,
you wouldn’t have liked that either, would you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” faltered Kitty; “I suppose not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, don’t you see? That’s a great point in his
favour. How much time did you want, or did he give
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I said I should answer before we left Quebec,” answered
Kitty, with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you know what to say now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can’t tell. That’s what I want you to help me think
out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ellison was silent for a moment before she said,
“Well, then, I suppose we shall have to go back to the
very beginning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” assented Kitty, faintly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You did have a sort of fancy for him the first time you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>saw him, didn’t you?” asked Mrs. Ellison coaxingly, while
forcing herself to be systematic and coherent, by a mental
strain of which no idea can be given.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said Kitty, yet more faintly, adding, “but I can’t
tell just what sort of a fancy it was. I suppose I admired
him for being handsome and stylish, and for having such
exquisite manners.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go on,” said Mrs. Ellison; “and after you got acquainted
with him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, you know we’ve talked that over once already,
Fanny.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but we oughtn’t to skip anything now,” replied
Mrs. Ellison, in a tone of judicial accuracy, which made
Kitty smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she quickly became serious again, and said, “Afterwards
I couldn’t tell whether to like him or not, or
whether he wanted me to. I think he acted very strangely
for a person in—love. I used to feel so troubled and
oppressed when I was with him. He seemed always to be
making himself agreeable under protest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps that was just your imagination, Kitty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps it was; but it troubled me just the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, and then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, and then after that day of the Montgomery
expedition he seemed to change altogether, and to try
always to be pleasant, and to do everything he could to
make me like him. I don’t know how to account for it.
Ever since then he’s been extremely careful of me, and
behaved—of course without knowing it—as if I belonged
to him already. Or maybe I’ve imagined that too. It’s
very hard to tell what has really happened the last two
weeks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kitty was silent, and Mrs. Ellison did not speak at once.
Presently she asked, “Was his acting as if you belonged to
him disagreeable?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>“I can’t tell. I think it was rather presuming. I don’t
know why he did it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you respect him?” demanded Mrs. Ellison.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Fanny, I’ve always told you that I did respect
some things in him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ellison had the facts before her, and it rested upon
her to sum them up, and do something with them. She
rose to a sitting posture, and confronted her task.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Kitty, I’ll tell you. I don’t really know what to
think. But I can say this: if you liked him at first, and
then didn’t like him, and afterwards he made himself more
agreeable, and you didn’t mind his behaving as if you
belonged to him, and you respected him, but after all
didn’t think him fascinating——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He <i>is</i> fascinating—in a kind of way. He was, from the
beginning. In a story his cold, snubbing, putting-down
ways would have been perfectly fascinating.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why didn’t you take him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because,” answered Kitty, between laughing and crying,
“it isn’t a story, and I don’t know whether I like
him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But do you think you might get to like him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t know. His asking brings all the doubts I ever
had of him, and that I’ve been forgetting the past two
weeks. I can’t tell whether I like him or not. If I did,
shouldn’t I trust him more?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, whether you are in love or not, I’ll tell you what
you <i>are</i>, Kitty,” cried Mrs. Ellison, provoked with her
indecision, and yet relieved that the worst, whatever it
was, was postponed thereby for a day or two.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’re——”</p>

<p class='c009'>But at this important juncture the colonel came lounging
in, and Kitty glided out of the room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Richard,” said Mrs. Ellison, seriously, and in a tone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>implying that it was the colonel’s fault, as usual, “you
know what has happened, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my dear, I don’t; but no matter: I will presently,
I daresay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I wish for once you wouldn’t be so flippant. Mr.
Arbuton has offered himself to Kitty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Colonel Ellison gave a quick, sharp whistle of amazement,
but trusted himself to nothing more articulate.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said his wife, responding to the whistle, “and it
makes me perfectly wretched.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I thought you liked him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I didn’t <i>like</i> him; but I thought it would be an
excellent thing for Kitty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And won’t it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She doesn’t know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doesn’t know?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel was silent, while Mrs. Ellison stated the case
in full, and its pending uncertainty. Then he exclaimed
vehemently as if his amazement had been growing upon
him. “This is the most astonishing thing in the world!
Who would ever have dreamt of that young iceberg being
in love?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Haven’t I <i>told</i> you all along he was?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes, certainly! but that might be taken either way,
you know. You would discover the tender passion in the
eye of a potato.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Colonel Ellison,” said Fanny, with sternness, “why do
you suppose he’s been hanging about us for the last four
weeks? Why should he have stayed in Quebec? Do you
think he pitied <i>me</i>, or found <i>you</i> so very agreeable?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I thought he found us just tolerable, and was
interested in the place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Ellison made no direct reply to this pitiable speech,
but looked a scorn which, happily for the colonel, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>darkness hid. Presently she said that bats did not express
the blindness of men, for any bat could have seen what was
going on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” remarked the colonel, “I did have a momentary
suspicion that day of the Montgomery business; they both
looked very confused when I saw them at the end of that
street, and neither of them had anything to say; but that
was accounted for by what you told me afterwards about
his adventure. At the time I didn’t pay much attention to
the matter. The idea of his being in love seemed too
ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it ridiculous for you to be in love with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; and yet I can’t praise my condition for its wisdom,
Fanny.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes! that’s <i>like</i> men. As soon as one of them is safely
married, he thinks all the love-making in the world has
been done for ever, and he can’t conceive of two young
people taking a fancy to each other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That’s something so, Fanny. But granting—for the
sake of argument merely—that Boston has been asking
Kitty to marry him, and she doesn’t know whether she
wants him, what are we to do about it? <i>I</i> don’t like him
well enough to plead his cause; do you? When does
Kitty think she’ll be able to make up her mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s to let him know before we leave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel laughed. “And so he’s to hang about here
on uncertainties for two whole days! That <i>is</i> rather rough
on him. Fanny, what made you so eager for this
business?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Eager? I <i>wasn’t</i> eager.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then,—reluctantly acquiescent?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, she’s so literary and that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How insulting! Intellectual, and so on; and I thought
she would be just fit to live in a place where everybody
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>is literary and intellectual. That is, I thought that, if I
thought anything.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said the colonel, “you may have been right on
the whole, but I don’t think Kitty is showing any particular
force of mind, just now, that would fit her to live in Boston.
My opinion is, that it’s ridiculous for her to keep him in
suspense. She might as well answer him first as last.
She’s putting herself under a kind of obligation by her
delay. I’ll talk to her——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you do, you’ll kill her. You don’t know how she’s
wrought up about it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, well, I’ll be careful of her sensibilities. It’s my
duty to speak with her. I’m here in the place of a parent.
Besides, don’t I know Kitty? I’ve almost brought her up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Maybe you’re right. You’re all so queer that perhaps
you’re right. Only do be careful, Richard. You must
approach the matter very delicately, indirectly, you know.
Girls are different, remember, from young men, and you
mustn’t be blunt. Do manœuvre a little, for once in your
life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All right, Fanny; you needn’t be afraid of my doing
anything awkward or sudden. I’ll go to her room pretty
soon, after she is quieted down, and have a good, calm,
old, fatherly conversation with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The colonel was spared this errand; for Kitty had left
some of her things on Fanny’s table, and now came back
for them with a lamp in her hand. Her averted face
showed the marks of weeping; the corners of her firm-set
lips were downward bent, as if some resolutions which she
had taken were very painful. This the anxious Fanny saw;
and she made a gesture to the colonel which any woman
would have understood to enjoin silence, or, at least, the
utmost caution and tenderness of speech. The colonel
summoned his <i>finesse</i> and said, cheerily, “Well, Kitty,
what’s Boston been saying to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Mrs. Ellison fell back upon her sofa as if shot, and placed
her hands over her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kitty seemed not to hear her cousin. Having gathered
up her things, she bent an unmoved face and an unseeing
gaze full upon him, and glided from the room without a
word.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, upon my soul,” cried the colonel, “this is
a pleasant, nightmarist, sleep-walking, Lady-Macbethish,
little transaction. Confound it, Fanny! this comes of your
wanting me to manœuvre. If you’d let me come straight <i>at</i>
the subject, like a <i>man</i>——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Please</i>, Richard, don’t say anything more now,” pleaded
Mrs. Ellison in a broken voice. “You can’t help it, I know;
and I must do the best I can, under the circumstances.
Do go away for a little while, darling! Oh dear!”</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>A TALE FOR THE HOLYDAYS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>EVERYBODY knows that in the famous city of New
York, whose proper name is New Amsterdam, the
excellent St. Nicholas—who is worth a dozen St. George’s
and dragons to boot, and who, if every tub stood on its
right bottom, would be at the head of the seven champions
of Christendom—I say, everybody knows the excellent St.
Nicholas, in holyday times, goes about among the people in
the middle of the night, distributing all sorts of toothsome
and becoming gifts to the good boys and girls in this his
favourite city. Some say that he comes down the chimneys
in a little Jersey waggon; others, that he wears a pair of
Holland skates, with which he travels like the wind; and
others, who pretend to have seen him, maintain that he
has lately adopted a locomotive, and was once actually
detected on the <i>Albany</i> railroad. But this last assertion
is looked upon to be entirely fabulous, because St. Nicholas
has too much discretion to trust himself in such a new-fangled
jarvie; and so I leave this matter to be settled by
whomsoever will take the trouble. My own opinion is that
his favourite mode of travelling is on a canal, the motion
and speed of which aptly comport with the philosophic
dignity of his character. But this is not material, and I
will no longer detain my readers with extraneous and
irrelevant matters, as is too much the fashion with our
statesmen, orators, biographers, and story-tellers.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty,
or sixty-one, for the most orthodox chronicles differ in this
respect; but it was a very remarkable year, and it was
called <i>annus mirabilis</i> on that account. It was said that
several people were detected in speaking the truth about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>that time; that nine staid, sober, and discreet widows, who
had sworn on an anti-masonic almanac never to enter a
second time into the holy state, were snapped up by young
husbands before they knew what they were about; that six
venerable bachelors wedded as many buxom young belles,
and, it is reported, were afterwards sorry for what they had
done; that many people actually went to church from
motives of piety; and that a great scholar, who had written
a book in support of certain opinions, was not only convinced
of his error, but acknowledged it publicly afterwards.
No wonder the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty,
if that was the year, was called <i>annus mirabilis</i>!</p>

<p class='c009'>What contributed to render this year still more remarkable
was the building of six new three-storey brick houses
in the city, and three persons setting up equipages, who,
I cannot find, ever failed in business afterwards or compounded
with their creditors at a pestareen in the pound.
It is, moreover, recorded in the annals of the horticultural
society of that day, which were written on a cabbage leaf,
as is said, that a member produced a forked radish of such
vast dimensions that, being dressed up in fashionable male
attire at the exhibition, it was actually mistaken for a
travelled beau by several inexperienced young ladies, who
pined away for love of its beautiful complexion, and were
changed into daffadowndillies. Some maintain it was a
mandrake, but it was finally detected by an inquest of
experienced matrons. No wonder the year seventeen
hundred and sixty was called <i>annus mirabilis</i>!</p>

<p class='c009'>But the most extraordinary thing of all was the confident
assertion that there was but one <i>grey mare</i> within the bill
of mortality; and, incredible as it may appear, she was
the wife of a responsible citizen, who, it was affirmed, had
grown rich by weaving velvet purses out of sows’ ears.
But this was looked upon as being somewhat of the
character of the predictions of almanac-makers. Certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>it is, however, that Amos Shuttle possessed the treasure
of a wife who was shrewdly suspected of having established
within doors a system of government not laid down in
Aristotle or the Abbe Sieyès, who made a constitution for
every day in the year, and two for the first of April.</p>

<p class='c009'>Amos Shuttle, though a mighty pompous little man out
of doors, was the meekest of human creatures within. He
belonged to that class of people who pass for great among
the little, and little among the great; and he would certainly
have been master in his own house had it not
been for a woman! We have read somewhere that no
wise woman ever thinks her husband a demigod. If so,
it is a blessing that there are so few wise women in the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'>Amos had grown rich, Heaven knows how—he did not
know himself; but, what was somewhat extraordinary, he
considered his wealth a signal proof of his talents and
sagacity, and valued himself according to the infallible
standard of pounds, shillings, and pence. But though he
lorded it without, he was, as we have just said, the most
gentle of men within doors. The moment he stepped inside
of his own house his spirit cowered down, like that of a
pious man entering a church; he felt as if he was in the
presence of a superior being—to wit, Mrs. Abigail Shuttle.
He was, indeed, the meekest of beings at home except
Moses; and Sir Andrew Aguecheek’s song, which Sir Toby
Belch declared “would draw nine souls out of one weaver,”
would have failed in drawing half a one out of Amos. The
truth is, his wife, who ought to have known, affirmed that
he had no more soul than a monkey; but he was the only
man in the city thus circumstanced at the time we speak of.
No wonder, therefore, the year one thousand seven hundred
and sixty was called <i>annus mirabilis</i>!</p>

<p class='c009'>Such as he was, Mr. Amos Shuttle waxed richer and
richer every day, insomuch that those who envied his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>prosperity were wont to say, “that he had certainly been
born with a dozen silver spoons in his mouth, or such a
great blockhead would never have got together such a heap
of money.” When he had become worth ten thousand
pounds, he launched his shuttle magnanimously out of the
window, ordered his weaver’s beam to be split up for oven
wood, and Mrs. Amos turned his weaver’s shop into a
<i>boudoir</i>. Fortune followed him faster than he ran away
from her. In a few years the ten thousand doubled, and
in a few more trebled, quadrupled—in short, Amos could
hardly count his money.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What shall we do now, my dear?” asked Mrs. Shuttle,
who never sought his opinion that I can learn, except for
the pleasure of contradicting him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us go and live in the country, and enjoy ourselves,”
quoth Amos.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go into the country! go to——” I could never satisfy
myself what Mrs. Shuttle meant; but she stopped short,
and concluded the sentence with a withering look of scorn,
that would have cowed the spirit of nineteen weavers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Amos named all sorts of places, enumerated all sorts of
modes of life he could think of, and every pleasure that
might enter into the imagination of a man without a soul.
His wife despised them all; she would not hear of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, my dear, suppose you suggest something; do
now, Abby,” at length said Amos, in a coaxing whisper;
“will you, my onydoney?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ony fiddlestick! I wonder you repeat such vulgarisms.
But if I must say what I should like, I should like to
travel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let us go and make a tour as far as Jamaica, or
Hackensack, or Spiking Devil. There is excellent fishing
for striped bass there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Spiking Devil!” screamed Mrs. Shuttle; “aren’t you
ashamed to swear so, you wicked mortal! I won’t go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Jamaica, nor Hackensack among the Dutch Hottentots,
nor to Spiking Devil to catch striped bass; I’ll go to
Europe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>If Amos had possessed a soul it would have jumped out
of its skin at the idea of going beyond seas. He had once
been on the sea-bass banks, and gone seasoning there, the
very thought of which made him sick. But as he had no
soul, there was no great harm done.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Mrs. Shuttle said a thing, it was settled. They
went to Europe. Taking their only son with them, the
lady ransacked all the milliners’ shops in Paris, and the
gentleman visited all the restaurateurs. He became such
a desperate connoisseur and gourmand, that he could almost
tell an <i>omelette au jambon</i> from a gammon of bacon.
After consummating the polish, they came home, the lady
with the newest old fashions, and the weaver with a confirmed
preference of <i>potage à la turque</i> over pepper-pot.
It is said the city trembled, as with an earthquake, when
they landed, but the notion was probably superstitious.</p>

<p class='c009'>They arrived near the close of the year, the memorable
year, the <i>annus mirabilis</i> one thousand seven hundred and
sixty. Everybody that had ever known the Shuttles flocked
to see them, or rather to see what they had brought with
them; and such was the magic of a voyage to Europe, that
Mr. and Mrs. Amos Shuttle, who had been nobodies when
they departed, became somebodies when they returned, and
mounted at once to the summit of <i>ton</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have come in good time to enjoy the festivities of
the holydays,” said Mrs. Hubblebubble, an old friend of
Amos the weaver and his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We shall have a merry Christmas and a happy New
Year,” exclaimed Mrs. Doubletrouble, another old acquaintance
of old times.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The holydays,” drawled Mrs. Shuttle; “the holydays?
Christmas and New Year? Pray what are they?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>It is astonishing to see how people lose their memories
abroad sometimes. They often forget their old friends, old
customs, and occasionally themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, la! now, who’d have thought it?” cried Mrs.
Doubletrouble; “why, sure you haven’t forgot the oily
cooks and the mince-pies, the merry meetings of friends,
the sleigh-rides, the Kissing Bridge, and the family
parties?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Family parties!” shrieked Mrs. Shuttle, and held her
salts to her nose; “family parties! I never heard of
anything so Gothic in Paris or Rome; and oily cooks—oh,
shocking! and mince-pies—detestable! and throwing
open one’s doors to all one’s old friends, whom one wishes
to forget as soon as possible—oh! the idea is insupportable!”
And again she held the salts to her nose.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Hubblebubble and Mrs. Doubletrouble found they
had exposed themselves sadly, and were quite ashamed. A
real, genteel, well-bred, enlightened lady of fashion ought
to have no rule of conduct, no conscience, but Paris—whatever
is fashionable there is genteel—whatever is not
fashionable is vulgar. There is no other standard of right,
and no other eternal fitness of things. At least so thought
Mrs. Hubblebubble and Mrs. Doubletrouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is it possible that all these things are out of fashion
abroad?” asked the latter, beseechingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They never were in,” said Mrs. Amos Shuttle. “For
my part, I mean to close my doors and windows on New
Year’s Day—I’m determined.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so am I,” said Mrs. Hubblebubble.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so am I,” said Mrs. Doubletrouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>And it was settled that they should make a combination
among themselves and their friends, to put down the
ancient and good customs of the city, and abolish the
sports and enjoyments of the jolly New Year. The conspirators
then separated, each to pursue her diabolical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>designs against oily cooks, mince-pies, sleigh-ridings, sociable
visitings, and family parties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now the excellent St. Nicholas, who knows well what is
going on in every house in the city, though, like a good
and honourable saint, he never betrays any family secrets,
overheard these wicked women plotting against his favourite
anniversary, and he said to himself—</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Vuur en Vlammen!</i> but I’ll be even with you, <i>mein
vrouw</i>.” So he determined he would play these conceited
and misled women a trick or two before he had done with
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now the first day of the new year, and Mrs. Amos
Shuttle, and Mrs. Doubletrouble, and Mrs. Hubblebubble,
and all their wicked abettors, had shut up their doors and
windows, so that when their old friends called they could
not get into their houses. Moreover, they had prepared
neither mince-pies, nor oily cooks, nor crullers, nor any of
the good things consecrated to St. Nicholas by his pious
and well-intentioned votaries, and they were mightily
pleased at having been as dull and stupid as owls, while
all the rest of the city were as merry as crickets, chirping
and frisking in the warm chimney-corner. Little did they
think what horrible judgments were impending over them,
prepared by the wrath of the excellent St. Nicholas, who
was resolved to make an example of them for attempting
to introduce their new-fangled corruptions in place of the
ancient customs of his favourite city. These wicked women
never had another comfortable sleep in their lives!</p>

<p class='c009'>The night was still, clear, and frosty—the earth was
everywhere one carpet of snow, and looked just like the
ghost of a dead world, wrapped in a white winding-sheet;
the moon was full, round, and of a silvery brightness, and
by her discreet silence afforded an example to the rising
generation of young damsels, while the myriads of stars
that multiplied as you gazed at them, seemed as though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>they were frozen into icicles, they looked so cold and
sparkled with such a glorious lustre. The streets and
roads leading from the city were all alive with sleighs
filled with jovial souls, whose echoing laughter and cheerful
songs mingled with a thousand merry bells, that jingled
in harmonious dissonance, giving spirit to the horses and
animation to the scene. In the licence of the season,
hallowed by long custom, each of the sleighs saluted the
other in passing with a “Happy New Year,” a merry jest,
or mischievous gibe, exchanged from one gay party to
another. All was life, motion, and merriment; and as old
frost-bitten Winter, aroused from his trance by the rout and
revelry around, raised his weather-beaten head to see what
was passing, he felt his icy blood warming and coursing
through his veins, and wished he could only overtake
the laughing buxom Spring, that he might dance a jig with
her, and be as frisky as the best of them. But as the old
rogue could not bring this desirable matter about, he contented
himself with calling for a jolly bumper of cocktail,
and drinking a swinging draught to the health of the
blessed St. Nicholas, and those who honour the memory
of the president of good-fellows.</p>

<p><span class='small'>“THE EXCELLENT ST. NICHOLAS OVERHEARD THESE WICKED WOMEN.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>All this time the wicked women and their abettors lay
under the malediction of the good saint, who caused them
to be bewitched by an old lady from Salem. Mrs. Amos
Shuttle could not sleep, because something had whispered in
her apprehensive ear that her son, her only son, whom she
had engaged to the daughter of Count Grenouille, in Paris,
then about three years old, was actually at that moment
crossing Kissing Bridge in company with little Susan
Varian, and some others besides. Now Susan was the
fairest little lady of all the land; she had a face and an
eye just like the widow Wadman in Leslie’s charming
picture; a face and an eye which no reasonable man under
Heaven could resist, except my uncle Toby—beshrew him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>and his fortifications, I say! She was, moreover, a good
little girl, and an accomplished little girl—but, alas! she
had not mounted to the step in Jacob’s ladder of fashion
which qualifies a person for the heaven of high <i>ton</i>, and
Mrs. Shuttle had not been to Europe for nothing. She
would rather have seen her son wedded to dissipation and
profligacy than to Susan Varian; and the thought of his
being out sleigh-riding with her was worse than the toothache.
It kept her awake all the live-long night, and the
only consolation she had was scolding poor Amos, because
the sleigh-bells made such a noise.</p>

<p class='c009'>As for Mrs. Hubblebubble and Mrs. Doubletrouble, they
neither of them got a wink of sleep during a whole week
for thinking of the beautiful French chairs and damask
curtains Mrs. Shuttle had brought from Europe. They
forthwith besieged their good men, leaving them no rest
until they sent out orders to Paris for just such rich chairs
and curtains as those of the thrice-happy Mrs. Shuttle,
from whom they kept the affair a profound secret, each
meaning to treat her to an agreeable surprise. In the
meanwhile they could not rest for fear the vessel which was
to bring these treasures might be lost on her passage. Such
was the dreadful judgment inflicted on them by the good
St. Nicholas.</p>

<p class='c009'>The perplexities of Mrs. Shuttle increased daily. In the
first place, do all she could, she could not make Amos a
fine gentleman. This was a metamorphosis which Ovid
would never have dreamed of. He would be telling the
price of everything in his house, his furniture, his wines,
and his dinners, insomuch that those who envied his
prosperity, or perhaps only despised his pretensions, were
wont to say, after eating his venison and drinking his old
Madeira, “that he ought to have been a tavern-keeper, he
knew so well how to make out a bill.” Mrs. Shuttle once
overheard a speech of this kind, and the good St. Nicholas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>himself, who had brought it about, almost felt sorry for
the mortification she endured on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely had she got over this, when she was invited to
a ball by Mrs. Hubblebubble, and the first thing she saw
on entering the drawing-room was a suite of damask curtains
and chairs, as much like her own as two peas, only the
curtains had far handsomer fringe. Mrs. Shuttle came
very near fainting away, but escaped for that time, determined
to mortify this impudent creature by taking not the
least notice of her finery. But St. Nicholas ordered it
otherwise, so that she was at last obliged to acknowledge
they were very elegant indeed. Nay, this was not the
worst, for she overheard one lady whisper to another that
Mrs. Hubblebubble’s curtains were much richer than Mrs.
Shuttle’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I daresay,” replied the other—“I daresay Mrs.
Shuttle bought them second-hand, for her husband is as
mean as pursley.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was too much. The unfortunate woman was taken
suddenly ill—called her carriage, and went home, where
it is supposed she would have died that evening had she
not wrought upon Amos to promise her an entire new
suite of French furniture for her drawing-room and parlour
to boot, besides a new carriage. But for all this she could
not close her eyes that night for thinking of the “second-hand
curtains.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor was the wicked Mrs. Doubletrouble a whit better off
when her friend Mrs. Hubblebubble treated her to the
agreeable surprise of the French window curtains and
chairs. “It is too bad—too bad, I declare,” she said to
herself; “but I’ll pay her off soon.” Accordingly she issued
invitations for a grand ball and supper, at which both Mrs.
Shuttle and Mrs. Hubblebubble were struck dumb at
beholding a suite of curtains and a set of chairs exactly of
the same pattern with theirs. The shock was terrible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>and it is impossible to say what might have been the consequences,
had not the two ladies all at once thought of
uniting in abusing Mrs. Doubletrouble for her extravagance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I pity poor Mr. Doubletrouble,” said Mrs. Shuttle,
shrugging her shoulders significantly, and glancing at the
room.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so do I,” said Mrs. Hubblebubble, doing the
same.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Doubletrouble had her eye upon them, and enjoyed
their mortification, until her pride was brought to the
ground by a dead shot from Mrs. Shuttle, who was heard
to exclaim, in reply to a lady who observed the chairs and
curtains were very handsome—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why yes, but they have been out of fashion in Paris a
long time; and, besides, really they are getting so common
that I intend to have mine removed to the nursery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Heavens! what a blow! Poor Mrs. Doubletrouble
hardly survived it. Such a night of misery as the wicked
woman endured almost made the good St. Nicholas regret
the judgment he had passed upon these mischievous and
conceited females. But he thought to himself he would
persevere until he had made them a sad example to all innovators
upon the ancient customs of our forefathers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus were these wicked and miserable women spurred
on by witchcraft from one piece of extravagance to another,
and a deadly rivalship grew up between them which
destroyed their own happiness and that of their husbands.
Mrs. Shuttle’s new carriage and drawing-room furniture in
due time were followed by similar extravagances on the part
of the two other wicked women who had conspired against
the hallowed institutions of St. Nicholas; and soon their
rivalship came to such a height that neither of them had a
moment’s rest or comfort from that time forward. But they
still shut their door on the jolly anniversary of St. Nicholas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>though the old respectable burghers and their wives, who
had held up their heads time out of mind, continued the
good custom, and laughed at the presumption of these upstart
interlopers who were followed only by a few people of
silly pretensions, who had no more soul than Amos Shuttle
himself. The three wicked women grew to be almost perfect
skeletons, on account of the vehemence with which they
strove to outdo each other, and the terrible exertions
necessary to keep up the appearance of being the best
friends in the world. In short, they became the laughing-stock
of the town; and sensible, well-bred folks cut their
acquaintance, except when they sometimes accepted an
invitation to a party, just to make merry with their folly
and conceitedness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The excellent St. Nicholas, finding they still persisted in
their opposition to his rites and ceremonies, determined to
inflict on them the last and worst punishment that can
befall the sex. He decreed that they should be deprived
of all the delights springing from the domestic affections, and
all taste for the innocent and virtuous enjoyments of a
happy fireside. Accordingly they lost all relish for home;
they were continually gadding about from one place to
another in search of pleasure, and worried themselves to
death to find happiness where it is never to be found.
Their whole lives became one long series of disappointed
hopes, galled pride, and gnawing envy. They lost their
health, they lost their time, and their days became days of
harassing impatience, their nights nights of sleeplessness,
feverish excitement, ending in weariness and disappointment.
The good saint sometimes felt sorry for them,
but their continued obstinacy determined him to persevere
in his plan to punish the upstart pride of these rebellious
females.</p>

<p class='c009'>Young Shuttle, who had a soul, which I suppose he
inherited from his mother, all this while continued his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>attentions to little Susan Varian, which added to the
miseries inflicted on his wicked mother. Mrs. Shuttle
insisted that Amos should threaten to disinherit his son,
unless he gave up this attachment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Lord bless your soul, Abby!” said Amos. “What’s the
use of my threatening; the boy knows as well as I do that
I’ve no will of my own. Why, bless my soul, Abby——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bless your soul!” interrupted Mrs. Shuttle; “I wonder
who’d take the trouble to bless it but yourself? However,
if you don’t I will.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Accordingly she threatened the young man with being
disinherited unless he turned his back on little Susan
Varian, which no man ever did without getting a heartache.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If my father goes on as he has done lately,” sighed the
youth, “he won’t have anything left to disinherit me of but
his affection, I fear. But if he had millions I would not
abandon Susan.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you not ashamed of such a low-lived attachment?
You that have been to Europe! But, once for all,
remember this, renounce this low-born upstart, or quit
your father’s house for ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upstart!” thought young Shuttle; “one of the oldest
families in the city.” He made his mother a respectful
bow, bade Heaven bless her, and left the house. He was,
however, met by his father at the door, who said to him—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Johnny, I give my consent; but mind don’t tell your
mother a word of the matter. I’ll let her know I’ve a soul
as well as other people,” and he tossed his head like a war-horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>The night after this Johnny was married to little Susan,
and the blessing of affection and beauty lighted upon his
pillow. Her old father, who was in a respectable business,
took his son-in-law into partnership, and they prospered so
well that in a few years Johnny was independent of all the
world, with the prettiest wife and children in the land. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>Mrs. Shuttle was inexorable, while the knowledge of his
prosperity and happiness only worked her up to a higher
pitch of anger, and added to the pangs of jealousy perpetually
inflicted on her by the rivalry of Mrs. Hubblebubble
and Mrs. Doubletrouble, who suffered under the like
affliction from the wrathful St. Nicholas, who was resolved
to make them an example to all posterity.</p>

<p class='c009'>No fortune, be it ever so great, can stand the eternal
sapping of wasteful extravagance, engendered and stimulated
by the baleful passion of envy. In less than ten years from
the hatching of the diabolical conspiracy of these three
wicked women against the supremacy of the excellent
St. Nicholas, their spendthrift rivalship had ruined the
fortunes of their husbands, and entailed upon themselves
misery and remorse. Rich Amos Shuttle became at last as
poor as a church mouse, and would have been obliged to
take to the loom again in his old age, had not Johnny, now
rich, and a worshipful magistrate of the city, afforded him
and his better half a generous shelter under his own happy
roof. Mrs. Hubblebubble and Mrs. Doubletrouble had
scarcely time to condole with Mrs. Shuttle, and congratulate
each other, when their husbands went the way of all flesh—that
is to say, failed for a few tens of thousands, and called
their creditors together to hear the good news. The two
wicked women lived long enough after this to repent of
their offence against St. Nicholas; but they never imported
any more French curtains, and at last perished miserably in
an attempt to set the fashions in Pennypot Alley.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mrs. Abigail Shuttle might have lived happily the rest
of her life with her children and grand-children, who all
treated her with reverent courtesy and affection, now that
the wrath of mighty St. Nicholas was appeased by her
exemplary punishment; but she could not get over her
bad habits and feelings, or forgive her lovely daughter-in-law
for treating her so kindly when she so little deserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>it. She gradually pined away; and though she revived
at hearing of the catastrophe of Mrs. Hubblebubble
and Mrs. Doubletrouble, it was only for a moment. The
remainder of the life of this wicked woman was a series
of disappointments and heartburnings, and when she died,
Amos tried to shed a few tears, but he found it impossible,
I suppose, because, as his wife always said, “he had no
soul.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the terrible revenge of St. Nicholas, which
ought to be a warning to all who attempt to set themselves
up against the venerable customs of their ancestors, and
backslide from the hallowed institutions of the blessed
saint, to whose good offices, without doubt, it is owing that
this, his favourite city, has transcended all others of the
universe in beautiful damsels, valorous young men, mince-pies,
and New Year cookies. The catastrophe of these
three wicked women had a wonderful influence in the city,
insomuch that from this time forward no <i>grey mares</i> were
ever known, no French furniture was ever used, and no
woman was hardy enough to set herself up in opposition
to the good customs of St. Nicholas. And so wishing many
happy New Years to all my dear countrywomen and
countrymen, saving those who shut their doors to old
friends, high or low, rich or poor, on that blessed anniversary
which makes more glad hearts than all others put
together,—I say, wishing a thousand happy New Years to
all, with this single exception, I lay down my pen, with a
caution to all wicked women to beware of the revenge
of St. Nicholas.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>ONE of the Boys mentioned, the other evening, in the
course of a very pleasant poem he read us, a little
trick of the Commons table-boarders, which I, nourished at
the parental board, had never heard of. Young fellows
being always hungry——Allow me to stop dead-short,
in order to utter an aphorism which has been forming itself
in one of the blank interior spaces of my intelligence, like
a crystal in the cavity of a geode.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order to know whether a human being is young or
old, offer it food of different kinds at short intervals. If
young, it will eat anything at any hour of the day or night.
If old, it observes stated periods, and you might as well
attempt to regulate the time of high-water to suit a fishing-party
as to change these periods.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crucial experiment is this. Offer a bulky and boggy
bun to the suspected individual just ten minutes before
dinner. If this is eagerly accepted and devoured, the fact
of youth is established. If the subject of the question
starts back and expresses surprise and incredulity, as if you
could not possibly be in earnest, the fact of maturity is no
less clear.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c009'>—Excuse me,—I return to my story of the Commonstable.
Young fellows being always hungry, and tea and
dry toast being the meagre fare of the evening meal, it was
a trick of some of the Boys to impale a slice of meat
upon a fork, at dinner-time, and stick the fork, holding it,
beneath the table, so that they could get it at tea-time.
The dragons that guarded this table of the Hesperides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>found out the trick at last, and kept a sharp look-out for
missing forks;—they knew where to find one, if it was not
in its place. Now the odd thing was that, after waiting
so many years to hear of this College trick, I should hear
it mentioned a <i>second time</i> within the same twenty-four
hours by a College youth of the present generation.
Strange, but true. And so it has happened to me and
to every person, often and often, to be hit in rapid succession
by these twinned facts or thoughts, as if they were
linked like chain-shot.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was going to leave the simple reader to wonder over
this, taking it as an unexplained marvel. I think, however,
I will turn over a furrow of subsoil in it. The explanation
is, of course, that in a great many thoughts there must be a
few coincidences, and these instantly arrest our attention.
Now we shall probably never have the least idea of the
enormous number of impressions which pass through our
consciousness, until in some future life we see the photographic
record of our thoughts and the stereoscopic picture
of our actions. There go more pieces to make up a
conscious life or a living body than you think for. Why,
some of you were surprised when a friend of mine told you
there were fifty-eight separate pieces in a fiddle. How
many “swimming glands”—solid, organised, regularly
formed, rounded disks, taking an active part in all your
vital processes, part and parcel, each one of them, of your
corporeal being—do you suppose are whirled along like
pebbles in a stream with the blood which warms your
frame and colours your cheeks? A noted German physiologist
spread out a minute drop of blood, under the
microscope, in narrow streaks, and counted the globules,
and then made a calculation. The counting by the
micrometer took him a <i>week</i>. You have, my full-grown
friend, of these little couriers in crimson or scarlet livery,
running on your vital errands day and night as long as you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>live, sixty-five billions, five hundred and seventy thousand
millions, errors excepted. Did I hear some gentleman say
“Doubted”? I am the Professor; I sit in my chair with a
petard under it that will blow me through the skylight of
my lecture-room, if I do not know what I am talking about,
and whom I am quoting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, my dear friends, who are putting your hands
to your foreheads and saying to yourselves that you
feel a little confused, as if you had been waltzing until
things began to whirl slightly round you, is it possible that
you do not clearly apprehend the exact connection of all
that I have been saying, and its bearing on what is now to
come? Listen, then. The number of these living elements
in our bodies illustrates the incalculable multitude of our
thoughts; the number of our thoughts accounts for those
frequent coincidences spoken of; these coincidences in
the world of thought illustrate those which we constantly
observe in the world of outward events, of which the
presence of the young girl now at our table, and proving to
be the daughter of an old acquaintance some of us may
remember, is the special example which led me through
this labyrinth of reflections, and finally lands me at the
commencement of this young girl’s story, which, as I said,
I have found the time and felt the interest to learn something
of, and which I think I can tell without wronging the
unconscious subject of my brief delineation.</p>

or such as favours its doctrines, is admitted, and all negative
evidence, or such as tells against it, is excluded. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>invariably connected with some lucrative practical application.
Its professors and practitioners are usually shrewd
people; they are very serious with the public, but wink
and laugh a good deal among themselves. The believing
multitude consists of women of both sexes, feeble-minded
inquirers, poetical optimists, people who always get cheated
in buying horses, philanthropists who insist on hurrying up
the millennium, and others of this class, with here and there
a clergyman, less frequently a lawyer, very rarely a physician,
and almost never a horse-jockey or a member of the
detective police.—I did not say that Phrenology was one
of the Pseudo-sciences.</p>

<p class='c009'>A Pseudo-science does not necessarily consist wholly
of lies. It may contain many truths, and even valuable
ones. The rottenest bank starts with a little specie. It
puts out a thousand promises to pay on the strength of a
single dollar, but the dollar is very commonly a good one.
The practitioners of the Pseudo-sciences know that common
minds, after they have been baited with a real fact or two,
will jump at the merest rag of a lie, or even at the bare
hook. When we have one fact found us, we are very apt
to supply the next out of our own imagination. (How many
persons can read Judges xv. 16 correctly the first time?)
The Pseudo-sciences take advantage of this.—I did not say
that it was so with Phrenology.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have rarely met a sensible man who would not allow
that there was <i>something</i> in Phrenology. A broad, high
forehead, it is commonly agreed, promises intellect; one
that is “villainous low,” and has a huge hind-head back of
it, is wont to mark an animal nature. I have as rarely met
an unbiassed and sensible man who really believed in the
bumps. It is observed, however, that persons with what
the Phrenologists call “good heads” are more prone than
others toward plenary belief in the doctrine.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is so hard to prove a negative, that if a man should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>assert that the moon was in truth a green cheese, formed
by the coagulable substance of the Milky Way, and
challenge me to prove the contrary, I might be puzzled.
But if he offer to sell me a ton of this lunar cheese, I call
on him to prove the truth of the caseous nature of our
satellite before I purchase.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>“I PROCEED TO FUMBLE HIS SKULL.”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is not necessary to prove the falsity of the phrenological
statement. It is only necessary to show that its
truth is not proved, and cannot be, by the common course
of argument. The walls of the head are double, with a
great air-chamber between them, over the smallest and
most closely crowded “organs.” Can you tell how much
money there is in a safe, which also has thick double
walls, by kneading its knobs with your fingers? So when
a man fumbles about my forehead, and talks about the
organs of <i>Individuality</i>, <i>Size</i>, etc., I trust him as much
as I should if he felt of the outside of my strong-box
and told me that there was a five-dollar or a ten-dollar
bill under this or that particular rivet. Perhaps there is;
<i>only he doesn’t know anything about it</i>. But this is a point
that I, the Professor, understand, my friends, or ought to,
certainly, better than you do. The next argument you will
all appreciate.</p>

<p class='c009'>I proceed, therefore, to explain the self-adjusting mechanism
of Phrenology, which is <i>very similar</i> to that of the Pseudo-sciences.
An example will show it most conveniently.</p>

<p class='c009'>A. is a notorious thief. Messrs. Bumpus and Crane
examine him and find a good-sized organ of Acquisitiveness.
Positive fact for Phrenology. Casts and drawings of A. are
multiplied, and the bump <i>does not lose</i> in the act of copying.—I
did not say it gained.—What do you look so for? (to
the boarders).</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently B. turns up, a bigger thief than A. But B.
has no bump at all over Acquisitiveness. Negative fact;
goes against Phrenology.—Not a bit of it. Don’t you see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>how small Conscientiousness is? <i>That’s</i> the reason B.
stole.</p>

<p class='c009'>And then comes C., ten times as much a thief as either
A. or B.,—used to steal before he was weaned, and would
pick one of his own pockets and put its contents in another,
if he could find no other way of committing petty larceny.
Unfortunately, C. has a <i>hollow</i>, instead of a bump, over
Acquisitiveness. Ah! but just look and see what a bump
of Alimentiveness! Did not C. buy nuts and gingerbread,
when a boy, with the money he stole? Of course you see
why he is a thief, and how his example confirms our noble
science.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last comes along a case which is apparently a <i>settler</i>,
for there is a little brain with vast and varied powers,—a
case like that of Byron, for instance. Then comes out the
grand reserve-reason which covers everything and renders
it simply impossible ever to corner a Phrenologist. “It is
not the size alone, but the <i>quality</i> of an organ, which
determines its degree of power.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Oh! oh! I see.—The argument may be briefly stated
thus by the Phrenologist: “Heads I win, tails you lose.”
Well, that’s convenient.</p>

<p class='c009'>It must be confessed that Phrenology has a certain
resemblance to the Pseudo-sciences.—I did not say it was
a Pseudo-science.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have often met persons who have been altogether
struck up and amazed at the accuracy with which some
wandering Professor of Phrenology had read their characters
written upon their skulls. Of course the Professor
acquires his information solely through his cranial inspections
and manipulations.—What are you laughing at?
(to the boarders).—But let us just <i>suppose</i>, for a moment,
that a tolerably cunning fellow, who did not know or care
anything about Phrenology, should open a shop and
undertake to read off people’s characters at fifty cents or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>a dollar a-piece. Let us see how well he could get along
without the “organs.”
I will suppose myself to set up such a shop. I would
invest one hundred dollars, more or less, in casts of brains,
skulls, charts, and other matters that would make the most
show for the money. That would do to begin with. I
would then advertise myself as the celebrated Professor
Brainey, or whatever name I might choose, and wait for
my first customer. My first customer is a middle-aged
man. I look at him,—ask him a question or two, so as to
hear him talk. When I have got the hang of him, I
ask him to sit down, and proceed to fumble his skull,
dictating as follows:—</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>THE most humorous sight which I have seen was an
English funeral, performed in the most fashionable
manner; for you must know they <i>perform funerals</i> here.
An undertaker’s sign exhibits these words, “Funerals performed.”
The first one which I saw was such a novelty, I
followed it a short distance, not knowing what it was; and,
as my manner is to question every one whom I think can give
me any information (a Yankee custom), I asked an honest
fellow “what the show was?” He seemed a little offended,
but directly replied, “<i>You may know one day, if you do not
come to the gallows.</i>” This man, like Chatham, was “original
and unaccommodating.” But, observing that I was surprised
at his answer, and feeling, perhaps, a little mortified, he
asked, “Do you live in London?” I told him I had just
come. “Well, but people die, sometimes, in your town.”
By this I discovered that the <i>performance</i> was a funeral.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>
  <h2 class='c004'><i>A NEW SYSTEM OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_65 c008'>I&nbsp;HAVE often thought that the adjectives of the English
language were not sufficiently definite for the purposes
of description.</p>

<p class='c009'>They have but three degrees of comparison—a very
insufficient number, certainly, when we consider that they
are to be applied to a thousand objects, which, though of
the same general class or quality, differ from each other
by a thousand different shades or degrees of the same
peculiarity. Thus, though there are three hundred and
sixty-five days in a year, all of which must, from the nature
of things, differ from each other in the matter of climate,
we have but half-a-dozen expressions to convey to one
another our ideas of this inequality. We say—“It is a fine
day;” “It is a <i>very</i> fine day;” “It is the <i>finest</i> day we have
seen;” or, “It is an unpleasant day;” “A <i>very</i> unpleasant
day;” “The <i>most</i> unpleasant day we ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But it is plain that none of these expressions give an
<i>exact</i> idea of the nature of the day; and the two superlative
expressions are generally untrue. I once heard a gentleman
remark, on a rainy, snowy, windy, and (in the ordinary
English language) indescribable day, that it was “most preposterous
weather.” He came nearer to giving a correct
idea of it than he could have done by any ordinary mode
of expression; but his description was not sufficiently
definite.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again:—we say of a lady—“She is beautiful;” “She is
<i>very</i> beautiful;” or “She is <i>perfectly</i> beautiful;” descriptions
which, to one who never saw her, are no descriptions at all,
for among thousands of women he has seen, probably no
two are equally beautiful; and as to a <i>perfectly</i> beautiful
woman, he knows that no such being was ever created—unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>by G. P. R. James, for one of the two horsemen to
fall in love with, and marry at the end of the second
volume.</p>

<p class='c009'>If I meet Smith in the street, and ask him—as I am
pretty sure to do—“How he does?” he infallibly replies,
“<i>Tolerable</i>, thank you,” which gives one no <i>exact</i> idea of
Smith’s health, for he has made the same reply to me on a
hundred different occasions, on every one of which there
<i>must</i> have been some slight shade of difference in his
physical economy, and of course a corresponding change in
his feelings.</p>

<p class='c009'>To a man of a mathematical turn of mind, to a student
and lover of the exact sciences, these inaccuracies of expression,
this inability to understand <i>exactly</i> how things are,
must be a constant source of annoyance; and to one who,
like myself, unites this turn of mind to an ardent love of
truth, for its own sake,—the reflection that the English
language does not enable us to speak the truth with exactness,
is peculiarly painful. For this reason I have, with
some trouble, made myself thoroughly acquainted with
every ancient and modern language, in the hope that I
might find some one of them that would enable me to
express precisely my ideas; but the same insufficiency of
adjectives exist in all except that of the Flathead Indians
of Puget Sound, which consists of but forty-six words,
mostly nouns, but to the constant use of which exists the
objection, that nobody but that tribe can understand it.
And as their literary and scientific advancement is not such
as to make a residence among them, for a man of my disposition,
desirable, I have abandoned the use of their
language, in the belief that for me it is <i>hyas</i>, <i>cultus</i>, or, as
the Spaniard hath it, <i>no me vale nada</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Despairing, therefore, of making new discoveries in
foreign languages, I have set myself seriously to work to
reform our own; and have, I think, made an important discovery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>which, when developed into a system and universally
adopted, will give a precision of expression, and a consequent
clearness of idea, that will leave little to be desired,
and will, I modestly hope, immortalise my humble name
as the promulgator of the truth, and the benefactor of the
human race.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before entering upon my system I will give you an
account of its discovery (which perhaps I might with more
modesty term an adaptation and enlargement of the idea of
another), which will surprise you by its simplicity, and, like
the method of standing eggs on end, of Columbus, the
inventions of printing, gunpowder, and the mariner’s compass—prove
another exemplification of the truth of Hannah
More’s beautifully expressed sentiment—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Large streams from little fountains flow,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Large aches from little toe-corns grow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>During the past week my attention was attracted by a
large placard embellishing the corners of our streets, headed
in mighty capitals with the word “<span class='fss'>PHRENOLOGY</span>,” and
illustrated by a map of a man’s head, closely shaven and
laid off in lots, duly numbered from one to forty-seven.
Beneath this edifying illustration appeared a legend, informing
the inhabitants of San Diego and vicinity that Professor
Dodge had arrived and taken rooms (which was inaccurate,
as he had but one room) at Gyascutus House, where he
would be happy to examine and furnish them with a chart
of their heads, showing the moral and intellectual endowments,
at the low price of three dollars each.</p>

<p class='c009'>Always gratified with an opportunity of spending my
money and making scientific researches, I immediately had
my hair cut and carefully combed, and hastened to present
myself and my head to the Professor’s notice. I found him
a tall and thin Professor, in a suit of rusty, not to say seedy
black, with a closely-buttoned vest, and no perceptible shirtcollar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>or wristbands. His nose was red, his spectacles were
blue, and he wore a brown wig, beneath which, as I subsequently
ascertained, his bald head was laid off in lots,
marked and numbered with Indian ink, after the manner of
the diagram upon his advertisement. Upon a small table
lay many little books with yellow covers, several of the
placards, pen and ink, a pair of iron callipers with brass
knobs, and six dollars in silver. Having explained the
object of my visit, and increased the pile of silver by six
half-dollars from my pocket—whereat he smiled, and I
observed he wore false teeth (scientific men always do;
they love to encourage art)—the Professor placed me in a
chair, and rapidly manipulating my head, after the manner
of a <i>shampooh</i> (I am not certain as to the orthography of
this expression), said that my temperament was “lymphatic,
nervous, bilious.” I remarked that “I thought myself
dyspeptic,” but he made no reply. Then, seizing on the
callipers, he embraced with them my head in various
places, and made notes upon a small card that lay
near him on the table. He then stated that my
“hair was getting very thin on the top,” placed in my
hand one of the yellow-covered books, which I found to
be an almanac containing anecdotes about the virtue of
Dodge’s Hair Invigorator, and recommending it to my
perusal, he remarked that he was agent for the sale of this
wonderful fluid, and urged me to purchase a bottle—price
two dollars. Stating my willingness to do so, the Professor
produced from a hair trunk that stood in the corner of the
room, which he stated, by the way, was originally an
ordinary pine box, on which the hair had grown since “the
Invigorator” had been placed in it—(a singular fact)—and
recommended me to be cautious in wearing gloves while
rubbing it upon my head, as unhappy accidents had
occurred—the hair growing freely from the ends of the
fingers, if used with the bare hand. He then seated himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>at the table, and rapidly filling up what appeared to
me a blank certificate, he soon handed over the following
singular document:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phrenological Chart of the Head of Mr. John Phœnix,
by Flatbroke B. Dodge, Professor of Phrenology, and
inventor and proprietor of Dodge’s celebrated Hair
Invigorator, Stimulator of the Conscience, and Arouser of
the Mental Faculties:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c031'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Temperament—<i>Lymphatic, Nervous, Bilious</i>.</div>

      <div class='line'>Philoprogenitiveness, 0.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c032'>Having gazed on this for a few moments in mute
astonishment—during which the Professor took a glass of
brandy and water, and afterwards a mouthful of tobacco—I
turned to him and requested an explanation.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Why,” said he, “it’s very simple; the number 12 is the
maximum, 1 the minimum; for instance, you are as
benevolent as a man can be—therefore I mark you,
Benevolence, 12. You have little or no self-esteem—hence
I place you, Self-esteem, ½. You’ve scarcely any credulity,
don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c032'><i>I did see!</i> This was my discovery. I saw at a flash
how the English language was susceptible of improvement,
and, fired with the glorious idea, I rushed from the room
and the house; heedless of the Professor’s request that I
would buy more of his Invigorator; heedless of his alarmed
cry that I would pay for the bottle I had got; heedless that
I tripped on the last step of the Gyascutus House, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>smashed there the precious fluid (the step has now a
growth of four inches of hair on it, and the people use it
as a door-mat); I rushed home, and never grew calm till
with pen, ink, and paper before me, I commenced the
development of my system.</p>

<p class='c032'>This system—shall I say this great system?—is exceedingly
simple, and easily explained in a few words. In the
first place, “<i>figures won’t lie</i>.” Let us then represent by
the number 100, the maximum, the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of every
human quality—grace, beauty, courage, strength, wisdom,
learning—everything. Let <i>perfection</i>, I say, be represented
by 100, and an absolute minimum of all qualities by the
number 1.</p>

<p class='c032'>Then by applying the numbers between, to the adjectives
used in conversation, we shall be able to arrive at a very
close approximation to the idea we wish to convey; in
other words, we shall be enabled to speak the truth.
Glorious, soul-inspiring idea! For instance, the most
ordinary question asked of you is, “How do you do?”
To this, instead of replying, “Pretty well,” “Very well,”
“Quite well,” or the like absurdities—after running through
your mind that <i>perfection</i> of health is 100, no health at all,
1—you say, with a graceful bow, “Thank you, I’m 52 to-day;”
or, feeling poorly, “I’m 13, I’m obliged to you,” or,
“I’m 68,” or “75,” or “87½” as the case may be! Do
you see how very close in this way you may approximate to
the truth; and how clearly your questioner will understand
what he so anxiously wishes to arrive at—your <i>exact</i> state of
health?</p>

<p class='c032'>Let this system be adopted into our elements of grammar,
our conversation, our literature, and we become at once an
exact, precise, mathematical, truth-telling people. It will
apply to everything but politics; there, truth being of no
account, the system is useless. But in literature, how
admirable! Take an example:—</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>As a 19 young and 76 beautiful lady was 52 gaily tripping
down the side-walk of our 84 frequented street, she accidentally
came in contact—100 (this shows that she came in
close contact)—with a 73 fat, but 87 good-humoured looking
gentleman, who was 93 (<i>i.e.</i>, intently) gazing into the
window of a toy-shop. Gracefully 56 extricating herself,
she received the excuses of the 96 embarrassed Falstaff with
a 68 bland smile, and continued on her way. But hardly—7—had
she reached the corner of the block, ere she was
overtaken by a 24 young man, 32 poorly dressed, but of an
85 expression of countenance; 91 hastily touching her 54
beautifully rounded arm, he said, to her 67 surprise—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Madam, at the window of the toy-shop yonder, you
dropped this bracelet, which I had the 71 good fortune to
observe, and now have the 94 happiness to hand to you.”</p>

<p class='c032'>(Of course the expression “94 happiness” is merely the
young man’s polite hyperbole.)</p>

<p class='c032'>Blushing with 76 modesty, the lovely (76, as before, of
course) lady took the bracelet—which was a 24 magnificent
diamond clasp—(24 <i>magnificent</i>, playfully sarcastic; it was
probably <i>not</i> one of Tucker’s) from the young man’s
hand, and 84 hesitatingly drew from her beautifully 38
embroidered reticule a 67 portemonnaie. The young man
noticed the action, and 73 proudly drawing back, added—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Do not thank me; the pleasure of gazing for an instant
at those 100 eyes (perhaps too exaggerated a compliment)
has already more than compensated me for any trouble that
I might have had.”</p>

<p class='c032'>She thanked him, however, and with a 67 deep blush and
a 48 pensive air, turned from him, and pursued with 33 slow
step her promenade.</p>

<p class='c032'>Of course you see that this is but the commencement of
a pretty little tale, which I might throw off, if I had a mind
to, showing in two volumes, or forty-eight chapters of thrilling
interest, how the young man sought the girl’s acquaintance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>how the interest first excited deepened into love, how
they suffered much from the opposition of parents (her
parents, of course), and how, after much trouble, annoyance,
and many perilous adventures, they were finally married—their
happiness, of course, being represented by 100. But
I trust that I have said enough to recommend my system
to the good and truthful of the literary world; and besides,
just at present I have something of more immediate
importance to attend to.</p>

<p class='c032'>You would hardly believe it, but that everlasting (100)
scamp of a Professor has brought a suit against me for
stealing a bottle of his disgusting Invigorator; and as the
suit comes off before a Justice of the Peace, whose only
principle of law is to find guilty and fine any accused person
whom he thinks has any money—(because if he don’t he
has to take his costs in County Scrip), it behoves me
to “take time by the forelock.” So for the present,
adieu!</p>

<p class='c032'>Should my system succeed to the extent of my hopes and
expectations, I shall publish my new grammar early in the
ensuing month, with suitable dedication and preface; and
should you, with your well-known liberality, publish my
prospectus, and give me a handsome literary notice, I shall
be pleased to furnish a presentation copy to each of the
little Pioneer children.</p>

<p class='c032'>P.S.—I regret to add, that having just read this article to
Mrs. Phœnix, and asked her opinion thereon, she replied
that, “If a first-rate magazine article were represented by
100, she should judge this to be about 13; or if the quintessence
of stupidity were 100, she should take this to be in
the neighbourhood of 96.”</p>

<p class='c032'>This, as a criticism, is perhaps a little discouraging, but
as an exemplification of the merits of my system it is
exceedingly flattering. How could she, I should like to
know, in ordinary language, have given so <i>exact</i> and truthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>an idea—how expressed so forcibly her opinion (which, of
course, differs from mine) on the subject?</p>

<p class='c032'>As Dr. Samuel Johnson learnedly remarked to James
Boswell, Laird of Auchinleck, on a certain occasion—“Sir,
the proof of the pudding is the eating thereof.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF AMERICAN HUMORISTS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c034'><span class='sc'>Aby, Joe C.</span>, “Hoffenstein,” born 1858. A humorist who made his
reputation on the <i>New Orleans Times-Democrat</i>. His “Hoffenstein”
sketches have been issued in book form.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Adams, Charles Follen</span> (1842). “Leedle Yawcob Strauss,” a
short poem bubbling over with quiet, kindly, pathetic humour,
given in quaint German-American vernacular, first brought Mr.
Adams before the public. “Leedle Yawcob Strauss” has been
followed by many sunny pieces in similar dialect. Mr. Adams has
published <i>Leedle Yawcob Strauss and other Poems</i>, <i>Dialect Ballads</i>,
etc.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Adams, John Quincy</span> (1767-1848), sixth President of the United
States, first attracted public attention by his writings, and principally
on account of his pen he was appointed to many honourable
posts by President George Washington. He wrote a number of
humorous pieces of verse, the most popular being “The Plague in
the Forest” and “The Wants of Man.”</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Alcott, Louisa May</span> (1832-1888). Author of <i>Little
Women</i>, <i>Little Men</i>, <i>Moods</i>, <i>An Old-Fashioned
Girl</i>, <i>Eight Cousins</i>, etc. Most popular with the young
people of America and Great Britain.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Alden, William L.</span>, born 1837. Author of <i>Domestic
Explosives</i>, <i>Shooting Stars</i>, <i>Moral Pirates</i>, <i>A Lost
Soul</i> (Chatto &amp; Windus), and a host of volumes of facetious short
stories. He was admitted to the bar, but took to journalism; made
himself famous as the “fifth-column man” on the <i>New York Times</i>;
was appointed consul-general at Rome, the king decorating him with the
cross of Chevalier of the “Crown of Italy” at the end of his
consulship. He introduced canoeing as a pastime into the United
States, and founded the first canoe club. He is now (1893) writing
humorous “stories” for the <i>Idler</i> and other English
publications, and his work has lost none of his old-time flavour.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Aldrich, Thomas Bailey</span>, born 1837. Mr. Aldrich, who for many
years was looked upon as one of the most promising younger
writers of America, has now attained the first rank in American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>poetry. His first great success was the <i>Ballad of Babie Bell</i>,
published in 1856, and this induced him to adopt literature as a
profession. In March 1881 he was appointed editor of the
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. Since <i>Babie Bell</i> appeared he has given to
the public much work of a high order. <i>Pampinea and other Poems</i>,
1861; <i>Poems</i> (two collections), 1863 and 1865; <i>Cloth of Gold</i>,
1874; <i>Flower and Thorn</i>, 1876; <i>Lyrics and Sonnets</i>, 1880, in
verse; and <i>Marjorie Daw and other People</i>, 1873; <i>Prudence
Palfrey</i>, 1874; <i>The Stillwater Tragedy</i>, 1880; <i>Mercedes</i>, 1883,
in prose, are well known in Great Britain and America. Messrs.
Macmillan &amp; Co. publish his works in England, and Houghton,
Mifflin, &amp; Co. in America.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Alsop, George</span>, born 1638. When twenty years old he sailed to
Maryland, and for four years laboured as a servant. At the
restoration of King Charles he, a warm Royalist, returned to
England, and whether he returned to America or not is uncertain.
He published <i>A Character of the Province of Maryland</i>, a volume
of prose and verse, absurdly humorous from beginning to end.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Alsop, Richard</span> (1761-1815). Founder of a society of literary-inclined
individuals known as the “Hartford Wits.” Alsop was the chief
writer of the <i>Echo</i>, a series of burlesque essays published between
1791 and 1795. He also published <i>The Enchanted Lake of Fairy
Morgana</i>, <i>Monody on the Death of Washington</i>, <i>The Natural
and Civil History of Chili</i>, and edited the <i>Captivity and Adventures
of J. R. Jewett among the Savages of Nootka Sound</i>. He was
an accomplished linguist.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Ames, Nathaniel</span> (1708-1764), commenced publishing in 1725 a
yearly calendar—the great-grandfather of the present weekly
paper. He was a shrewd wit, and his almanac, which obtained
marked popularity, was full of quaint and wise sayings.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Anderson, Mrs. Arestine</span> (1855). A writer of humorous newspaper
verse. Contributor to many of the humorous papers in America.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>André, Major John</span> (1751-1780). This unfortunate soldier wrote a
humorous piece entitled “The Cow Chase,” which, strangely
enough, appeared in <i>Rivington’s Royal Gazette</i> the same day that
the author was captured.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Arnold, George</span> (1834-1865). Author of <i>McArone Papers</i>, <i>The
Jolly Old Pedagogue, and other Poems</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Austin, William</span> (1778-1841). His “Peter Rugg, the Missing Man,”
published in the <i>New England Galaxy</i>, made a great hit, and his
“Letters from London” are full of quiet humour and quaint
information. He was also the author of “Oration on the Anniversary

adopted journalism as a profession, was appointed (1870) state
librarian for Virginia. His humorous articles were published under
the pen-name “Mozis Addums,” and after his death his sketches
were collected and published by Mrs. Bagby in three volumes.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Bailey, James Montgomery</span>, born 1841. In 1873 and 1874 America,
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, was laughing at the “Danbury
News-Man’s” funny articles. His work was to be found copied in
every paper in the land, and the <i>Danbury News</i>, which up to that
time had claimed only local attention, soon rose in circulation,
until it had readers in every state in the Union. Mr. Bailey,
whose laughable sketches made this sensation, began life as a
carpenter, served in the ranks during the war, and then entered
journalism. His humorous sketches have been collected and
published. <i>Life in Danbury</i> and <i>England from a Back Window</i>
are the best compilations.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Bangs, J. K.</span> Has published the <i>Tiddledywink Poetry Book</i>. His

to England to take part in the political movements of the day,
and published his <i>Advice to the Privileged Orders</i>, which the Government
proscribed. He took refuge in France, and while there
wrote “Hasty Pudding,” his most popular poem. After serving
his country diplomatically on a number of trying occasions, he,
while acting as minister to France, set out to visit Napoleon,
then on his Russian campaign, and died of cold in the famous
retreat from Moscow.</p>

lakes, appointed marine editor of the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>, and is
now commercial editor of the paper. Has written under the

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Barr, Robert</span> (1851), co-editor of the <i>Idler</i> (1892),
and for many years connected with the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. His
humorous sketches and short stories, both humorous and dramatic, under
the <i>nom de guerre</i> of “Luke Sharp,” first made him known to the
readers of the United Kingdom and America, but lately he has taken to
writing under his proper name. His published works are <i>In a Steamer
Chair, and other Shipboard Stories</i> (Chatto &amp; Windus), <i>From

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Bartlett, Joseph</span> (1762-1827), graduated at Harvard, studied law,
and travelled to England to spend his money, which he easily succeeded
in doing, and as a result found himself in prison for debt.
In prison he wrote a play, and with the money obtained for it
bought his release. Trying the stage for a while and not making
headway, he obtained a cargo of goods on credit for sale in America,
set sail, and was shipwrecked. In Boston he started in business,
failed, opened a law office in Woburn, and removed to Cambridge.
There he wrote “Physiognomy,” a poem lampooning
celebrities of the day, and afterwards “The New Vicar of Bray.”
He died penniless.</p>

1840 he founded the <i>New World</i>, and, with others, edited it for
five years. His principal works are <i>Infatuation</i> and <i>Poetry</i>, both

taken to America while still a child, he earned enough money to
put himself through Princetown, graduating in 1771, and rose to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>be one of the Justices of Pennsylvania Supreme Court (1799).
<i>Modern Chivalry, or the Adventures of Captain Farrago and
Teague O’Regan his Servant</i>, published in Pittsburg, 1796, a
political satire, established his reputation as a humorist.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Brainard, John Gardiner Calkins</span> (1796-1828). Studied law, but
on being called to the bar he forsook his profession for that of

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Browne, Charles Farrar</span> (1834-1867), “Artemus Ward.” When
fifteen years old he contributed comic articles to the <i>Carpet Bag</i>, a
Boston weekly. Subsequently he secured the situation of reporter
on the <i>Cleveland Plaindealer</i>, a paper of good standing, and while
acting in that position commenced his showman articles. The
first of these were written in a careless style, more as a “fill up”
than anything else, but finding that they met with extraordinary
success Mr. Browne began taking greater pains with them, and the
result is a series of as clever and humorous articles as America has
produced. He was a successful lecturer, and in this capacity
visited England in 1866, but his health, which had long been
failing, became so poor that he was forced to cancel engagements.
He died in Southampton, England.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Browne, John Ross</span> (1817-1875), author of <i>Yusef</i>, <i>American

<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span><i>The Rise and Fall of the Moustache</i>, <i>Hawkeyes</i>, <i>Sumach
Garden</i>, and other comic sketches. His humour is of the evanescent
quality, and suited better to the columns of a daily or weekly paper
than to publication in book form.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Burton, William Evans</span>, born in England, 1804; died in America,
1860. In 1834 he emigrated to America, and for a time was the

were published in 1841. They are “A Journey to the Land of
Eden,” “A Progress to the Mines,” and “History of the Dividing
Line.” He wrote verse, and was considered a great wit.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Carleton, Will</span>, born 1845. Without doubt the most popular
humorous verse-writer of the day in America. His versification is far
from being irreproachable, but he takes the everyday occurrences of
life and treats them in a simple humorous style which appeals to the
great public. His works are, <i>Farm Ballads</i>, <i>Farm Legends</i>,
<i>Young Folks’ Rhymes</i>, <i>Farm Festivals</i>, <i>City
Ballads</i>, <i>City Legends</i>, all published by Harper’s, New York,
and most of them by Sampson Low, Marston, &amp; Co., London. For pictures
of rural life his work is invaluable.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span><span class='sc'>Clemens, Samuel Langhorne</span>, born 1835. A true citizen of the
United States, he began at the bottom of the ladder and has
worked his way to the top. After receiving a meagre education at
a village school, he was apprenticed to a printer at the age of
thirteen, and for three years “stuck type.” In 1851 he took to
the Mississippi, earning his living as a pilot, and later on tried
mining and editing. Under the pseudonym “Mark Twain” he
began to publish the work which has earned for him the right to
be considered the greatest humorous writer of the century. <i>The
Jumping Frog and other Sketches</i> was his first book, appearing
in 1867, and this he has followed with a splendid line of successes
down to <i>The American Claimant</i>, which has just appeared.

literary work on the <i>Toronto Globe</i>, and, after occupying positions
on the staff of the <i>Globe</i> and <i>Washington Post</i>, spent a session at
Ottawa as special correspondent of the <i>Montreal Star</i>. This newspaper
training is clearly shown in her two clever books, <i>A Social
Departure</i> and <i>An American Girl in London</i>. The first is an
original and wholly unconventional account of travel, telling how
she, in company with another girl, went round the world. The
other book is an equally bright description of her doings in
London.</p>

all brightened by a vein of refined and genial humour. His chief
works are<i> Nile Notes</i>, <i>The Howadji in Syria</i>, <i>Lotus-Eating</i>,

for years. He published many works of a quietly humorous
character.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Fessenden, Thomas Green</span> (1771-1837). When at Dartmouth
College he wrote “Jonathan’s Courtship,” a ballad which became
popular, and was reprinted in England. He studied law and
wrote humorous verse until 1801, when he was sent to England
with a newly-patented hydraulic machine which proved a failure.
This and other patents in which he experimented ruined him.
Returning to America, he edited for a time the <i>New York Weekly
Inspector</i>, and from this time till his death was connected with one

other, they have not yet appeared in book form in England.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Franklin, Benjamin</span> (1706-1790) It is difficult to say what
Franklin was not, and there can be no question of his being the
best-informed man of his day. Along with his other virtues,
he was a humorist, and sparkling witty in conversation and
writing. He was the first American to achieve cosmopolitan fame
as a writer.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Freneau, Philip</span> (1752-1832). He commenced to write poetry
before he left college, and continued to do so all his life. As a

to New York, by Robert Slender, Stocking-Weaver,” published
1787.</p>

Sayings and Doings of Sam Slick</i>; and this he followed up with
<i>Bubbles of Canada</i>, <i>Letter Bag of the Great Western</i>, <i>Yankee
Stories</i>, <i>Nature and Human Nature</i>, etc.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Halleck, Fitz-Greene</span> (1790-1867), a descendant of John Eliot,
“The Apostle of the Indians.” In 1819 he and John Rodman
Drake published the <i>Croaker Papers</i>, humorous and satirical, which
attracted much attention at the time. These papers he followed
with “Fanny,” his longest poem, hitting off the follies of the day.
These are his chief contributions to humorous literature.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span><span class='sc'>Halpine, Charles Graham</span> (1829-1868), “Miles O’Reilly,” a verse-writer.
Established with “Mrs. Partington” a humorous paper
called <i>The Carpet Bag</i>, which proved a failure. He enlisted
during “the war,” and worked his way up until he finally became
a colonel. He issued <i>Life and Adventures, Songs, Services, and
Speeches of Private Miles O’Reilly, 47th Regiment, New York
Volunteers</i>, and <i>A Collection of Essays, Poems, Speeches, and
Banquets by Private Miles O’Reilly. Collected, Revised, and

<i>Pretzelisms, My Book of Expressions</i>, etc., humorous compilations
in Dutch dialect.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Harris, Joel Chandler</span>, born 1848. The greatest exponent of
the negro dialect. In the columns of the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>, of
which he is editor and part proprietor, his <i>Uncle Remus</i> sketches
first saw the light, and proved enormously successful. His humour
is delicate and fascinating, and as a consequence the <i>Remus</i>
series of books have had a world-wide circulation. No lover of
the humorous should overlook Mr. Harris’s work. American
publishers, Appleton &amp; Co.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Harte, Francis Bret</span>, born 1836. Taking full advantage of his
unique acquaintance with the West of America during the stirring
days of ’49, when, in California, he was in turn gold-digger,
express-rider, printer, and editor, Bret Harte has given to the
world volume after volume of short stories which picture in an
inimitable way the manners and men of the gold days. No writer
is more characteristically American than he; his style is vivid and
beautiful, and he has a wonderful fund of humour, which appears in
every line he writes. His published works, prose and verse, are
many. Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus have recently published a complete
edition of his writings. American publishers, Houghton,
Mifflin, &amp; Co.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Hawthorne, Nathaniel</span> (1804-1864). Like most men of exceptional
worth in literature; he found great difficulty at first in getting
his work published. After writing and destroying many tales, he
published, at his own expense, a novel entitled <i>Fanshawe</i>, which
proved a failure; and it was not until 1837 that he, or rather
a friend, induced a publisher to bring out <i>Twice-told Tales</i>. In
the spring of 1850 appeared <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, which raised the
author from obscurity to the front rank of American literature,
and the works which followed established his position in the
letters of his country.</p>

Bludso,” both strong pieces of verse.</p>

essayist, and poet, began literary work at an early age, and for
more than half a century has written industriously and with consistent
success. The <i>Breakfast-Table</i> series is among the most
read of all America’s humorous writings, and various short poems
of a humorous nature, such as “The One-Hoss Shay,” “Contentment,”
“The Spectre Pig,” etc., are in every compilation of
humour. His chief works are <i>The Autocrat at the Breakfast-Table</i>,
<i>The Professor at the Breakfast-Table</i>, <i>The Poet at the
Breakfast-Table</i>, <i>Songs of Many Seasons</i>, <i>Songs in Many Keys</i>.
He is one of the small band of humorists who are as carefully read

Columbia.”</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span><span class='sc'>Howard, Bronson</span> (1842). The most successful American dramatist
of the day, and almost the only American whose plays command
attention in England. His plays, <i>Saratoga</i>, <i>Truth</i>, <i>The Old

others are full of humour, and have been successful on both sides the
Atlantic.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Howells, William Dean</span>, born 1837. He is now America’s representative
novelist, and has qualified for representation in a
humorous book by his comedies, <i>Out of the Question</i>, <i>A Counterfeit

famous “Hartford Wits.”</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Hunter-Duvar, Lieutenant-Colonel John</span> (1830), one of the
principal literary men of Canada, his work polished, bright, and
full of imagination. His “Emigration of the Fairies,” a poem of
117 stanzas of six lines each, is quite the best piece of verse as
regards light, fantastical, imaginative humour that Canada has
produced. Many of his lyrics are dainty and sweet, with a seventeenth
century ring about them. He has published in verse <i>De
Roberval</i>, a drama dealing with early life in Canada, <i>The Triumph
of Constancy</i>, <i>The Enamorado</i>, and for private circulation, <i>John a’
Var, his Lays</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Huntley, Stanley.</span> In 1881 Mr. Huntley joined the staff of the

delightful and quaint humour, <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>, <i>Sketch Book</i>,
<i>History of New York by Diedrich Knickerbocker</i>, etc. A hospitable,
vivacious, good-natured, humorous man, who, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>opening of his career, was much harassed by business worries, and
it was not until his books had scattered his fame broadcast, and
the revenue from his writings began to accrue to him, that he
could lead the life of hearty hospitality and freedom he loved.
He was one of the small band of American authors which first
attracted attention outside of their own country, and established
the literary reputation of America.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Lanigan, George Thomas</span> (1845-1886), a Canadian journalist
who drifted across the borders, and who, after filling important
positions on the staff of many of the great American newspapers,
died in Philadelphia. He was a brilliant and versatile journalist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>and his poems, “The Ahkoond of Swat” and “Dirge of the
Moolta Kotal,” are masterpieces of oddness of theme and
wording.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Leland, Charles Godfrey</span> (1824). Best known to lovers of the
humorous as the author of the laughable <i>Breitmann Ballads</i>.
Since fifteen years of age Mr. Leland has been busy with his pen,
and there is no greater authority on folk-lore, superstition, and
legend than he. He has written many volumes of verse, sketches
of travel, etc., and is still (1893) hard at work.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Lewis, Charles B.</span>, “<span class='sc'>M Quad</span>,” born 1842. The creator of <i>His
Honor and Bijah</i>, his first great success; <i>The Lime Kiln Club</i>,
with all its comical darkey characters; <i>Carl Dunder</i>, the unsophisticated
Dutchman who is always being “shwindled”; <i>The
Arisona Kicker</i>, whose editor keeps a private graveyard; and <i>Mr.
and Mrs. Bowser</i>. “M Quad” is without question the greatest
newspaper humorist of America. His style is deliciously original;
he can write weekly for years on the same subject without wearying
the reader.  “Quad” is popularly known as the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>
man, from his long connection with that weekly.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Lighthall William Douw</span>, born 1857. His <i>Songs of the Great

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Longstreet, Augustus Baldwin</span> (1790-1870), in turn a lawyer,
legislator, judge, editor, Methodist minister, college president, and
farmer. He was a ready and brilliant speaker, and an industrious
writer of humour and pathos. His <i>Georgia, Scenes, Characters,
and Incidents</i>, first published in periodicals, and afterwards collected
in book form, were widely read. The papers are full of humour,
rather broad, but it is said by those who know, truly characteristic
of the place and period.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span><span class='sc'>Low, Samuel</span>, born 1765. Author of two volumes of poetry, containing
many pieces of a humorous character.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Lowell, James Russell</span> (1819-1891), poet, essayist, and
diplomat. One of the foremost literary geniuses of America. His first
volume of poems was published in 1838, under the title of <i>Class
Poems</i>. In 1841 followed <i>A Year’s Life</i>, consisting mainly of
love poems, only a few of which the author in later years considered
worth republishing. In the year 1846 the <i>Biglow Papers</i> began
appearing in the columns of the <i>Boston Courier</i>, and it was not
until 1848 that what is probably the most remarkable series of
satirical poems which ever appeared were furnished. For wit, insight
into human nature, and finish, these poems, in the peculiar dialect of
the “down-easter,” must be considered nothing short of perfect. These
poems had an instantaneous effect on America, and raised the question
of slavery and corruption in politics to the eyes of the people in a
way they had never before been presented. Mr. Lowell was an
out-and-out democrat and a fearless exponent of democracy of the kind
established by the founders of American independence. His works, of
which a complete and excellent edition is published by Messrs.
Macmillan &amp; Co., London, are numerous, the best known being <i>Class
Poems</i>, <i>A Year’s Life</i>, <i>Poems</i> (1844), <i>The Vision of

from Boston Town,” and “Saratoga and the Psalmist,” all
humorous verse, have been widely read.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Mitchell, Donald Grant</span>, born 1822. His delicate health compelled
him to abandon the study of law, and he has spent most
of his time in landscape gardening, writing, and travelling. His
first book, <i>Fresh Gleanings, or a New Sheaf from the Old Field of
Continental Europe</i>, was published in 1847, and in 1850 his
widely-read work, <i>Reveries of a Bachelor</i>, appeared. In the
sixties appeared the “Edgewood” series of books from his pen.
Most of his humorous work appeared under the pen-name of “Ike
Marvel.”</p>

in 1843, with N. P. Willis, the <i>New Mirror</i>; and in 1845 himself
founded the <i>National Press</i>, afterwards the <i>Home Journal</i>. <i>The
Little Frenchman and his Water-Lots</i>, a volume of prose sketches,
published in 1839, was widely read; but his greatest hits were
made by the songs, “Woodman, spare that Tree,” “We were
Boys together,” “My Mother’s Bible,” and “Whip-poor-will.”</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Morton, Thomas</span>, born in England about 1575; died in America,

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Neal, John</span> (1793-1876). “Yankee Neal,” as he was called, at the
age of thirty, set sail for England, determined that the British
people should no longer be able to say that no one reads an

writing in London, and was successful beyond his expectation.

history of American journalism. He has the reputation of being able to
tell a plainer lie—professionally, of course—than any man in America.
His principal books are <i>Sense</i>, <i>Nonsense</i>, <i>Brick
Dust</i>, <i>Home Harmonies</i>, and <i>Perpetual Money</i>.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Riley, James Whitcomb</span> (1854). Mr. Riley is writing the typically
American verse of the day, and his work is now read by a
larger public than any other American poet finds. His poems,
humorous or otherwise, are full of tender feeling, and in them
the tear invariably accompanies the smile. He has a perfect
command of the country dialects, and pictures as no other writer
seems able to do, the humorous and the pathetic side of American
life. A number of his books have been published in England.
<i>Old Fashioned Roses</i>, by Messrs. Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., and
other volumes by Messrs. Gay &amp; Bird. In America the Bowen-Merrill
Co., Indianapolis, publish <i>The Old Swimmin’-Hole, and
’Leven More Poems</i>; <i>The Boss Girl, and other Sketches and
Poems</i>; and <i>Afterwhiles</i>. Mr. Riley’s verses, “Old Man and
Jim,” and “Little Orphant Annie,” are popular with reciters on
both sides the Atlantic.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span><span class='sc'>Roche, James Jeffrey</span> (1847), editor of the <i>Boston
Pilot</i>, and author of <i>Songs and Satires</i>. Has written a great
deal of humorous verse.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Russell, Irwin</span> (1853-1879). According to Joel Chandler Harris,
Mr. Russell was the first Southern writer to appreciate the literary
possibilities of the negro character. Mr. Russell’s short life was
one of hard work and disappointments, and it was not until after
his death that his poems were collected and published. “Christmas
Night in the Quarters” is the best of his poems.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Sanderson, John</span> (1783-1844). <i>The American in England</i> and
<i>The American in Paris</i> are works which attained wide circulation
at the time of publication.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Saxe, John Godfrey</span> (1816-1887), a humorist whose command of
rhyme was as complete as that of “Ingoldsby.” He was a prolific
writer of humorous verse, and also wrote much that is in a
serious vein. Mr. Saxe was an ardent politician, holding the
position of State Attorney for Cheltenden, co. Vt., and in 1859,
and again in 1860, was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for
governor of that state. Many of his poems saw original publication
in <i>Harper’s Magazine</i> and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Scollard, Clinton</span> (1860), a writer of fanciful and sparkling
verse. His books of verse, <i>Pictures in Song</i>, <i>With Reed and
Lyre</i>, and <i>Old and New World Lyrics</i>, have been successful.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Seccomb, John</span> (1708-1793). Educated at Harvard, and settled as
a minister at Chester, Nova Scotia, where he died. Author of
“Father Abbey’s Will,” a humorous piece of verse, published in the
<i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>, May 1732.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Shanly, Charles Dawson</span> (1811-1875), born in Ireland and died
in Florida. He is claimed as a Canadian, he having held a
government office for fifteen years in Canada before going to New
York to engage in journalism. He was editor of <i>Vanity Fair</i> and
<i>Mrs. Grundy</i>, New York publications, and contributed to the
<i>New York Leader</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and other periodicals. He
wrote “A Jolly Bear and his Friends,” “The Monkey of Porto
Bello,” “The Truant Chicken,” and “The Walker of the
Snow,” a well-known poem. See Lighthall’s <i>Songs of the Great
Dominion</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Sharp, Luke.</span> <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Robert Barr</span>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Shaw, Henry Wheeler</span>, 1818-1885 (“Josh Billings”). In compilations
of American humour “Josh Billings” has always been
popular. His pungent paragraphs are very convenient to fill the
chinks between longer articles. A great deal of his humour is
in the spelling; but his “sayings” are full of philosophy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>wisdom, to which the orthography gives a certain quaintness.
His publications are <i>Josh Billings his Sayings</i>, <i>Josh Billings on
Ice</i>, <i>Every Boddy’s Friend</i>, and <i>Josh Billings’ Spice Box</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Shelton, Frederick William</span> (1814-1881), author of <i>The
Trollopiad</i>, <i>Rector of St. Bardolph’s</i>, <i>Peeps from the
Belfry</i>, etc. Mr. Shelton was a clergyman who found authorship more
congenial and profitable, and so devoted himself to writing.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Sherman, Frank Dempster</span> (1860), author of <i>Madrigals and
Catches</i> and <i>Lyrics for a Lute</i>, volumes of dainty verse.</p>
<p class='c023'>“<span class='sc'>Sherwood Bonner.</span>” <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>MacDowell</span>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Shillaber, Benjamin P.</span> (1814-1890). No series of newspaper articles
in the humorous vein attracted greater attention than that written
by Mr. Shillaber under the <i>nom de guerre</i> “Mrs. Partington.”
These short articles were full of good-natured humour, and never
failed to draw a smile from the reader.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Sill, Edward Rowland</span> (1841-1887). His poems contain a few
pieces of pleasant fancy.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Small, Samuel W.</span>, born 1851, a Southern humorist who published
articles under the pseudonym “Old Si.”</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Smith, James</span> (1720-1806), a signer of the Declaration of Independence.
Alexander Graydon, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, says that Smith was accounted
a consummate humorist by those who knew him.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Smith, Major Charles H.</span>, “Bill Arp,” born 1826. His humorous
sketches, published in the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>, have long been
popular reading in the Southern States. He served in the Confederate
army during the war.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Smith, Rev. William Wye</span> (1827), a Canadian writer whose poems
are popular in his native country. See Lighthall’s <i>Songs of the
Great Dominion</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Smith, Seba</span>, <i>nom de guerre</i>, “Major Jack Downing” (1792-1868). A
journalist who, after editing the <i>Eastern Argus</i>, <i>Family Recorder</i>,
and <i>Portland Daily Courier</i>, wrote during the presidency of Jackson
the famous series of satirical letters which made the name
“Jack Downing” celebrated in America. In 1842 he removed
from Portland to New York city, and published <i>Powhatan</i>, <i>New
Elements of Geometry</i>, <i>Way Down East</i>. He was all his life a
journalist.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Spoopendyke.</span> <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Huntley</span>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span><span class='sc'>Steel, Richard</span>, famous paragraphist of Chicago from about 1870 to
1882.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Stockton, Francis Richard</span>, born 1834. Educated in Philadelphia,
he first became an engraver, but abandoned this for journalism.
After some experience in newspaper work he joined the staff of
<i>Scribner’s Monthly</i>, and subsequently was appointed assistant-editor
of <i>St. Nicholas</i>. His first great success was made with the
<i>Rudder Grange</i> stories, and few short stories have attracted such a
reading public as “The Lady or the Tiger.” All his writings
are rich in quiet and quaint humour, and no writer can tell a more
genial and interesting story. A convenient-sized and inexpensive
edition of his works, including <i>Rudder Grange</i>, from which
“Pomona’s Novel” is taken, <i>The Lady or the Tiger? and other
Stories</i>, and <i>A Borrowed Month, and other Stories</i>, is published
by David Douglas, Edinburgh. American publishers, Charles
Scribner’s Sons.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Strother, David Hunter</span> (1816-1888), an artist as well as a

Crayon,” and illustrated his own work. Published works, <i>The
Blackwater Chronicle</i> and <i>Virginia Illustrated</i>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Sweet, Alexander Edwin</span>, Canadian, born 1841. After an
adventurous youth he became editor of the <i>San Antoine Express</i>

articles known as the “Major Jones’ Series,” in which the humour
is plentiful. He was the first white child born in the Western
Reserve.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Thoreau, Henry David</span> (1817-1862), one of the best known of the
New England “transcendentalists.” He has a fine vein of ironic
humour. His <i>Walden</i> and <i>A Week on the Concord and Merrimac
Rivers</i> have had a wide circulation in England.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Timothy Titcomb.</span> <i>See</i> <span class='sc'>Holland</span>.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Trowbridge, John Townsend</span> (1827). The most popular writer of

of the Supreme Court, and in 1800 Supreme Justice. He was the
first to use the Yankee dialect in literature, and his play, <i>The

Welsh physician, and died in Newfoundland.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Ward, Nathaniel</span>, born between 1578-80, died 1652. He was a
Puritan minister whose convictions got him into trouble with Archbishop
Laud, and in 1633 he was deprived of his living. The next
year he sailed for America and settled at Ipswich, and there compiled

Franklin, author of <i>Bachelors’ Hall</i>. He studied at Oxford, took
to the stage, failed, and, joining the army, was sent to America,
where he deserted, and worked as a printer in Philadelphia.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Weems, Mason Locke</span> (1760-1825), an eccentric character: clergyman,
story-teller, fiddler, and historian and book agent. In the
latter capacity, and with his fiddle always within reach, he
travelled through the rural districts of America, present at every
merry-making, and always pressing his wares on the people. He
wrote much in the way of history, in which a little fact suffices to
carry a great deal of entertaining fiction; and it is on his doubtful
authority that the famous story of Washington and his hatchet has
been given to the world.</p>
<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Whitcher, Mrs. Frances Miriam</span>, “<span class='sc'>Widow Bedott</span>”

Mirror</i>, and under his care that weekly became the foremost literary
paper of America, and continued to hold that position while Mr.

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Wright, Robert H.</span> (1868), author of the “Pete Parean”
papers, written in the French-Canadian <i>patois</i>. The dialect is not
first-class, but the papers are humorous.</p>

months, during which time he contributed verse that was quoted
all over “the States.” He suddenly disappeared, and it is not

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
